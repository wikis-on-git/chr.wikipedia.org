== connectivity project ==
Hallo, my name is Anastasiya Lvova, I'm "duty" in [http://toolserver.org/~lvova/cgi-bin/go.sh?language=chr&interface=en&listby=zns Connectivity project]. The essence of the "Connectivity" project is to study and [http://toolserver.org/~lvova/cgi-bin/go.sh enhance] the coherence of Wikipedia, or, in other words, to improve hypertext navigation between articles. The project deals with deadends, isolated articles, non-categorized articles, transitivity of the category tree, etc.

We want to work with your language version, but we need configured MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage for it (with direct links to template namespace pages, for example, [[:ru:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]/[[:de:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]/[[:fr:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]). Is it possible to set it up for our usage? 

thanks in advance, [[User:Lvova|Lvova]] 18:53, 12 DᎡᎭᎷᏱ 2010 (UTC)

==Page Text Editing==
We need to be on the lookout for bad translations into Cherokee. There tends to be many words translated improperly. Sometimes this is an improper verb form or a verb put where there should be a noun and vice versa. This is probably due to the fact that many dictionaries are incomplete. and example would be "run" this could be many things in English (a run in fabric, different verbal meaning such as fast movement with the feet, or the act of controlling a business or group). I don't always know the correct Cherokee words either, but I recogize incorrect ones simply because I know what they mean or I use them. When I see something from one of the documents I will be more specific. Peace and love to all.

==Interface Translating==
A whole bunch of works been done already, can one of our admin's import the data from:

What exactly is this page for? --[[User:DarkFantasy|DarkFantasy]] 20:08, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Things seem to be slowing down considerably.  Any ideas on how to get others interested in ''wigiquediya''? --[[User:DarkFantasy|DarkFantasy]] 20:08, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Yes, somewhere here have discussion and pooling of minds on large problems of displaying and entering things entirely in Unicode. On my computer, even at 250% magnification, some of the characters cannot be distinguished, and I haven't yet done any of the vast work needed to *enter* in the syllabary. You might look at the talk page here in regards to Unicode.


What "it" exists, that we need/needed to contact all the entities about? (here just below)

Yes, yes, it does exist. I haven't been able to do anything with it lately until now. I would recommend calling and e-mailing all governmental Cherokee tribal groups you can. I'm going to be doing the same. --[[User:Etse|Etse]] 16:26, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)



==ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ namespace doesn't exist yet==
The namespace "Wikipedia:" hasn't been translated to "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:", so it is a bad idea to use its translation now.
You should contact a developper and ask him to put "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ"  for the "Wikipedia" namespace in the LanguageChr.php file on the server.
Once it is done, then [[{{ns:4}}:Foo]] would expand to "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:Foo"
[[User:Srtxg|Srtxg]] 02:44, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)

From a linguistic standpoint "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ" (Wikiquediya) is actually perfect. "Encyclopedia" itself is after all not of English origin, but greek. English is likely the only language in the world in which word is pronounced in-say-klo-pi-di-ya. Even then is it not uniform but only by way of dialect... Some Americans, and especially many Brits pronounce the word in-say-klo-pe-di-ya or even en-si-klo-pe-di-ya. In addition most of the western world outisde of the English language zones pronounce it similarly to the latter. We should keep in mind that English is not the only language in the world we should consider when translating/transliterating words/documents. In fact, due to the vowel shift which took place in England between the 15th - 17th centuries, English should prety much never be considered the sole language for source translations for example, English "cow" = Cherokee "waga" which comes from Spanish "vaca" If we only considerd english for these things it would make it a lot more difficult to form words in Cherokee, since English is the Western European word that is the least phonetically similar to Cherokee. Sometimes a German ("Datsi" > Ger "Deutsch"), Spanish (Squani), French (Galvtsi > L. Gallicus) or Latin word works a lot better.

:Well, we will agree to disagree on this point.  "Digoweli Gatsanula Gadugi" is a better name "books that are fast make by working together".  WikiWiki means "fast" in Polynesian, which is where the word for Wiki came from in the first place -- "Fast Books" [[User:Jeffrey V. Merkey|Jeffrey V. Merkey]] 17:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

::The Wiktionary Project is now up. What should that be transcribed as? ᏫᎩ what?

you could say that, and i would not necessarily disagree. However the issue was not about using somethin authentically translated but rather the proper transliteration of Wikipedia to fit into Cherokee Phonetics (wigiquediya vs wigiquidiya). The explanation given was probably not worth disagreeing with. Furthermore, the magic of the Cherokee language is that you can get away with using fewer words than in other languages. To actually Translate into two words and add an extra "Digoweli Gatsanula Gadugi" would be quite impractical. especially when the alternative of sticking to the standard formation chosen by all the other languages exists... (fr, pt, sl) Wikipédia (En, es, de, ne, sw, pl, no, fi etc), Wikipedia, (ru)Википедия(wikipedia), (catalan) Viquipèdia, (welsh)Wicipedia, (icelandic) Wikipediu, (greek) Βικιπαίδεια, (turkish) Vikipedi 

Note that under the title for all of thes it has their own word for encyclopedia (english = Wikipedia the free encyclopedia)
to deviate would be somewhat risable Even in Swahili, a language which developed its own word for encyclopedia that is by no means related to the greek compound (enkyklios paideia "encircled/circular, or general education") that we now use in english, uses "Wikipedia" wikiquediya/wigiquediya is as close to perfect transliteration (not translation) as one can get.

now, for further development of our wonderful language known as Cherokee, it would be nice to develop a word/compound for encyclopedia since it has yet to exist.. that or it wold also need to be transliterated.
nigav dideloquasdi (ᏂᎦᎥ ᏗᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ) = general education, dideloquasdi alenvdodi (ᏗᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ ᎠᎴᏅᏙᏗ) = education basis, dideloquasdi alenvdisgv (ᏗᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ ᎠᎴᏅᏗᏍᎬ) = education base, Gvwatuwidv dideloquasdi (ᎬᏩᏚᏫᏓ ᏗᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ)= circular education which is a literal translation of "enkyklios paideia" or why not just enkitloquedeya (ᎡᎾᎩᏠᏇᏗᏯ)to avoid confusion between the book itself and the actuaual general education the thing to remember is that greek, as do latin and german, forms new words in much the same was as cherokee (combining old ones).
 
Wiktionary??? well, that is quite simple, though I also at first was stumped, but after thinking a bit, and realizing i also speak italian and other latin languages from which dictionary come... wiktsiyonali, witsiyonali(fr dictionnaire, sp diccionario, it dizionario (ditsiyonario), la dictionarius (diktsiyonarius)) Wiktionary is the domain and the title for most languages French Wiktionnaire and Icelandic Wikiorðabók... german calls it Wikiwortbuch in the title (by the way it is a loan translation of the latin word dictio meaning word)  you coulde theoretically tack wiki- onto the beginning of the cherokee word for dictionary,... thus, wikididetloquasdodi

==Translations==
Is there a comprehensive list of all translated namespaces, etc.? I would like to make basic items like stub notices except I don't know if they have been translated or not. [[User:Wikiacc|Wikiacc]] 22:56, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==New pages==

As far as I can see, relevant new pages are and should be welcome both in Cherokee and not. I see no evidence of a valid policy contrary to this.

Obviously, content in the language, in the syllabary, is best. Wigiqediya osdadv !


== Wigiquedia -- wouldn't Wikiquidia be better?==

Even though some of us have a hard time visually distinguishing qui from tlu, qui (rhymes with "tree" ) is much closer in sound than is que (rhymes with "day"). It seems much better to say wigi-kwee-diya for Wikipedia than to say wigi-quay-diya. In other words, the 3rd vowel of the usual chart rather than the 2nd.


Wigiquediya is perfect. it does not have to rhyme with English. On the other hand it does indeed rhyme with standard British english, as well as many American dialects and it is truer to Greek pronunciation. The origin of the latin Encyclopedia, to which it is also truer (Ancient Greek general education ενκύκλιος παιδεία enkyklios paideia Modern Greek, εγκυκλοπαιδεία, egkyklopaideia... pronounced eykiklopeideia)

== Plantagenet font ==
I recently created an SVG version of [[w:Image:Cherokee Syllabary.png]] using the Plantagenet characters. In the original PNG image, the character for "Do" (Ꮩ) looks like a capital V, but in the ([[w:Image:Cherokee Syllabary.svg|SVG version made using the Plantagenet font]], it looks like an upside down V. Is the Plantagenet font incorrect, or was the original image at fault?

I might have trouble finding my way back here, so please respond in [[w:User_talk:Sakurambo|my en:wikipedia talk page]]. [[w:User:Sakurambo|Sakurambo]] [[w:User_talk:Sakurambo|<font style="color: #f06; border: 1px solid #f6a; background-color: #fff8f0;">桜ん坊</font>]] 12:01, 9 November 2007 (UTC)


April 11, 2008: The image is not at fault. The Plantagenet font was based on the historical fonts used in the earliest printed versions of the language. Several letters were eventually reoriented or changed because some font characters were too easily confused. The "do" character was flipped because in small print, the original version and the "go" character (Ꭺ) were almost impossible to distinguish one from the other. tlw

== Meetup about and around less resourced languages ==

Hi, some of you might already know that we are going to have a meeting about and around less resourced languages on 31st of May 2008, which among others involves the Wikimedia projects, in particular Wikipedia. For most less resourced languages Wikipedia is the first collaborative project. We will talk also about tools, like Apertium which can help a lot, and about Betawiki for the localization of the User Interface of not only Wikipedias, but all Mediawiki projects in general. Furthermore you will be able to know about activities like the Open Nursery project which collects and creates contents, concentrating on less resourced languages, how elders work together with young people to keep their language alive, about kids in Africa who may not use their mother tongue at school. You will have the possibility to watch videos about topics which reach from how the UN and UNESCO see the actual language pictures to projects like a grammar checking engine, a successful localization project and some more topics.

Of course, all of you are invited to meet up with us in Cherasco (yes, there is a Wiki-Camp available) and those who cannot come are invited to follow us on web-tv (we are not sure now if we will be live or if the presentations will be online as soon as possible after they are on, but in any case you will be able to watch or the videos with relevant information or see us live.

*Click [http://gopiedmont.org/contn%C3%B9/programme-international-day-31st-may-english-language here] for the programme of the 31st of May
*Click [http://gopiedmont.org/contn%C3%B9/lodging-and-travel here] for information about lodging and travel
*Click [http://gopiedmont.org/contn%C3%B9/festa-d%C3%ABl-piemont-english-programme here] for the programme from 21st May to 1st June
*Click [http://gopiedmont.org/contn%C3%B9/eng-1-piedmont-festival-web-tv here] to watch the WEB-TV (right now there are just two videos, one slide show and the information for the wiki camp online – we are still working on the actuall programming for the conference)

Well there is one more thing to tell you/to ask: of course it is very relevant for us as a foundation to know about the actual needs in your language community, why you find the projects you contribute to useful, what are your personal goals. You can post your comments under the programme of 31st May or send an e-mail with your notes to info [at] voxhumanitatis.org. Please note that Vox Humanitatis is non-politica. More info about us can be found at our [http://voxhumanitatis.org website] where you also find the projects we support, a link to our scope and a link to our members.

Should you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to contact us.

Thank you for your attention and we hope to meet you soon!

Cheers :-) --[[User:SabineCretella|SabineCretella]] 21:37, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

== The most often used MediaWiki messages ==
Hoi, the most often used MediaWiki messages (less than 25% of all MediaWiki messages) are the most visible messages. They help our readers and editors the most. We are aiming to get these messages localised for as many languages as possible by the end of the year. Please help us and yourself and localise [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&task=untranslated&group=core-mostused&language={{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}&limit=100 these messages]. Thanks, [[User:GerardM|GerardM]] 10:44, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

==Global bots==

Hello. To facilitate [[m:steward|steward]] granting of bot access, I suggest implementing the [[m:Bot policy|standard bot policy]] on this wiki. In particular, this policy allows stewards to automatically flag known interlanguage linking bots (if this page says that is acceptable), which form the vast majority of such requests. The policy also enables [[m:Bot policy#Global_bots|global bots]] on this wiki (if this page says that is acceptable), which are trusted bots that will be given bot access on every wiki that allows global bots.

This policy makes bot access requesting much easier for local users, operators, and stewards. To implement it we only need to create a redirect to this page from [[Project:Bot policy]], and add a line at the top noting that it is used here. Please read the text at [[m:Bot policy]] before commenting. If you object, please say so; I hope to implement in one week if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interested in bot access requests. [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 13:15, 28 DᎡᎭᎷᏱ 2009 (UTC)

== Close this wiki ==

Has anyone objections against closing of this project. If there is no objections within 1 month I will support the closing of this project [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 13:15, 28 DᎡᎭᎷᏱ 2009 (UTC)

==The LocalisationUpdate extension has gone live==

The LocalisationUpdate extension is now enabled for all Wikimedia projects. From now on new localisations that become available in SVN will become available to your project within 24 hours. Your localisations get into SVN from [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net] typically within a day and at worst in two days. This is a huge improvement from the old practice where the localisations became available with new software. This could take weeks, even months.

The localisations done by our community at translatewiki.net are committed to SVN typically every day. When the system messages in English are the same as the local messages, they will now be inserted in a file and are available for use in all our projects in a timely manner

===What this means for you===
Local messages have an impact on the performance of our system. It is best when messages are as much as possible part of the system messages. In order to remove unnecessary duplication, all the messages that have a local localisation and are '''exactly''' the same as the system message will be removed.  What we ask you to do is to compare and proof read the messages in translatewiki.net and the local messages. You can then either remove local messages when the translatewiki.net message is to be preferred or, you can update the message at translatewiki.net. 

Messages that are specific to your project will have to stay as they are. You do want to check if the format and the variables of the message are still the same.

===Why localise at translatewiki.net===
When you localise at translatewiki.net, your messages will be used in all Wikimedia projects and eventually in all MediaWiki based projects. This is how we provide the standard support for your language. When messages change, at translatewiki.net you will be prompted to revisit your translations. Localising is more efficient because we have innovated the process to make you more efficient; there is text explaining about messages and we have applied AJAX technology to reduce the number of clicks you have to make.

==Translatewiki.net update==
*Currently 1.83% of the MediaWiki messages and 0.04% of the messages of the extensions used by the Wikimedia Foundation projects have been localised. Please help us help your language by localising and proof reading at [[betawiki:Special:LanguageStats/{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}|translatewiki.net]].

==How can we improve the usability for your language==
We expect that with the implementation of LocalisationUpdate the usability of MediaWiki for your language will improve. We are now ready to look at other aspects of usability for your language as well.  There are two questions we would like you to answer:
Are there issues with the new functionality of the Usability Initiative
Does MediaWiki support your language properly

The best way to answer the first question is to visit the translatewiki.net. Change the language to your language, select the “vector” skin and add the advanced tool bar in in the preferences and check out the new functionality. And make some changes in your user page. When there is a need to improve on the localisation, please make the [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-ui-0-all necessary changes]s . It should update your localisation straight away. 
We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_issues.

When there are problems with the support of MediaWiki for your language, we really want to know about this. It is best to report each issue separately. In this way there will be no large mass of issues to resolve but we can address each issue on its own. Consider issues with the display of characters, the presentation of your script, the position of the side bar, the combination of text with other languages, scripts. It is best to try this in an environment like the prototype wiki as it provides you with a clean, basic and up to date environment. The prototype wiki is available for five languages but you can select any of them, change the preferences to your language and test out MediaWiki for your language.

We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language issues. The issues you raise will all be assessed. It is important to keep each issue separate, because this will make it easier to understand the issues and find solutions.

==Fundraising 2010==
Hello Wikimedians,

As many of you are aware, we are now two months away from the Fundraiser for the Wikimedia Foundation, 2010.  We have lofty goals, and we can meet them and exceed them!

The meta translators are already actively engaged in the annual drive to distribute our messages and we encourage you to do the same, but we would like to point everyone to the developments we've made in banner messages- from creation to commentary to the ones that will go live for test and for the drive itself in November.  It's one of our goals to make sure that all volunteers know that there is a place for them in the Fundraising drive.  We've started the setup on [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 meta] for both [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages banner submission], [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Banner_testing statistical analysis], and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Committee grouping volunteers together] that would like to find specific focus and work in that area.

This year the Wikimedia Foundation is taking a proactive stance in reaching out to each and every Wikimedia project and volunteer to find innovation, collaboration, and collation of ideas from the community driven process.  The staff working on this is comprised of long-time Wikimedians with as much care and concern for the success of this drive as the volunteers, and we want you to actively participate and have a voice.

Use the talk pages on meta, talk to your local communities, talk to others, talk to us.  Engagement is what we strive for, without each other we would never had made Wikimedia succeed.  Everyone is welcome to contact any of us on staff at any time with a timely response to follow.  We actively encourage focusing discussion on meta so we can all work together.

Please translate this message into your language if you can and post it below.

See you on the wiki!  [[User:Kpeterzell|Keegan, WMF Fundraiser 2010]] 05:56, 8 September 2010 (UTC)
==Fundraising and your wiki==

Greetings, please translate this message if you can.

[[m:Fundraising 2010|Fundraising 2010]] is preparing to start, and we want your project to be a part of the global movement to support free knowledge.  The Wikimedia Foundation is engaging with local communities that build the projects to play an active part in this year's fundraiser.  This year we will be working to best serve all the language communities by providing messages that are best suited for each location.

To do this, we need your help.  We are [[m:Fundraising_2010/Messages|testing messages]] and we want to be sure that our messages will work with your language.  If it does not and your community can come up with your own banner in the spirit of supporting free knowledge, we invite you to submit your proposals and be active in this process.  Wikimedia is for you, join us in supporting free knowledge in your local community!  [[User:Kpeterzell|Keegan, WMF Fundraiser 2010]] 05:00, 15 September 2010 (UTC)

==Beat Jimmy==
Please translate this message.

The Fundraising Committee is issuing all interested community members a challenge: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 we want you to beat Jimmy]. The appeal from Jimmy Wales and the corresponding banner have been tested head-to-head with other successful banners, and the results are clear: it's our best performing message... by a lot. This year we have a lofty fundraising goal; we need all of our banners to bring in donations like the Jimmy Appeal, but no one wants to keep the Jimmy banner up for two months.  We want to run donor quotes, and other wonderful ideas, but we have to have banners that work as well as or better than the Jimmy appeal.

We've just released the highlights from a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010#Focus_Group donor focus group], and the results of our [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FR_Donor_survey_report.pdf donor survey]. With one month to the launch of the fundraiser, the messages we test must be driven by data from our tests and surveys - we can no longer rely on instinct alone. 

We've redesigned our fundraising meta pages with the Jimmy challenge; check out the survey results and propose/discuss banners that reflect these findings.  Add the banners you think will 'beat Jimmy' [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages/BeatJimmy here] to be tested Tuesday October 12 against Jimmy.

== Call for image filter referendum ==

The Wikimedia Foundation, at the direction of the Board of Trustees, will be holding a vote to determine whether members of the community support the creation and usage of an opt-in personal image filter, which would allow readers to voluntarily screen particular types of images strictly for their own account.

Further details and educational materials will be available shortly.  The referendum is scheduled for 12-27 August, 2011, and will be conducted on servers hosted by a neutral third party.  Referendum details, officials, voting requirements, and supporting materials will be posted at [[Meta:Image filter referendum]] shortly.

Sorry for delivering you a message in English. Please help translate the pages on the referendum on Meta and join the [[mail:translators-l|translators mailing list]].

==Language support group for Cherokee==
The Wikimedia Foundation has brought together a new team of developers who are dedicated to language support. This team is to support all the languages and consequently it is not realistic to expect that the team members can provide proper support for your language. It is for this reason that we are looking for volunteers who will make up a [[:translatewiki:language support team|language support team]]. 

This language support team will be asked to provide us with information about their language. Such information may need to be provided either to us or on a website that we will indicate to you. Another activity will be to test software that will likely have an effect on the running of the MediaWiki software. We are looking for people who clearly identify their ability. Formal knowledge is definitely appreciated.

As much of the activity will be concentrated on [[:translatewiki:Main Page|translatewiki.net]], it will be a plus when team members know how to localise at translatewiki.net.

Hello,
 
The Wikimedia Foundation is discussing changes to its Terms of Use.  The discussion can be found at [[m:Talk:Terms of use|Talk:Terms of use]]. Everyone is invited to join in. Because the new version of [[m:Terms of use|Terms of use]] is not in final form, we are not able to present official translations of it. Volunteers are welcome to translate it, as German volunteers have done at [[:m:Terms of use/de]], but we ask that you note at the top that the translation is unofficial and may become outdated as the English version is changed.

==2011 Fundraising Is Almost Here==
[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|left]] Hello Wikipedians, my name is Alex and I am working for the Wikimedia Foundation during the 2011 Fundraiser. This year's fundraiser is intended to be a collaborative and global effort; we recognize that messages which may  perform well in the United States don't necessarily translate well, or appeal to international audiences. <br>

I'm contacting you as I am currently looking for volunteers who are willing to contribute to this project by helping [[m:Fundraising_2011/Translation|translate]] and [[m:Fundraising_2011/Local_testing|localize messages]] into your local language, suggesting [[m:Fundraising_2011/communityappeal|community appeals]] for us to use,  and to provide us with feedback on the [[m:Fundraising_2011|Fundraising Meta Page]]. We've started the setup on [[m:Fundraising_2011|meta]] for both [[m:Fundraising_2011/Translation|translation]], [[m:Fundraising_2011/Tech_stats_and_resources|statistical analysis]], and [[m:Fundraising_2011/Local_testing|local discussion and testing]]. We actively encourage focusing discussion on meta so we can all work together. <br>Use the talk pages on meta, talk to your local communities, talk to others, talk to us.  Engagement is what we strive for, without each other we would never had made Wikimedia succeed. The staff working on this fundraiser is comprised of long-time Wikimedians with as much care and concern for the success of this drive as the volunteers, and we want you to actively participate and have a voice. Everyone is welcome to contact any of us on staff at any time with a timely response to follow.  I look forward to working with you during this year's fundraiser.

If someone could translate this message I would really appreciate it so that everyone is able to understand our goals and contribute to this year's campaign.<br>[[User:Azariv|Azariv]] 23:19, 31 October 2011 (UTC)

== Announcing Wikipedia 1.19 beta ==

Wikimedia Foundation is getting ready to push out 1.19 to all the WMF-hosted wikis.  As we finish wrapping up our code review, you can test the new version ''right now'' on [http://beta.wmflabs.org/ beta.wmflabs.org].  For more information, please read the [https://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/RELEASE-NOTES-1.19?view=markup release notes] or the [[mw:MediaWiki_1.19|start of the final announcement]].

The following are the areas that you will probably be most interested in:
* [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33711#c2 Faster loading of javascript files makes dependency tracking more important.]
* New common*.css files usable by skins instead of having to copy piles of generic styles from MonoBook or Vector's css.
* The default user signature now contains a talk link in addition to the user link.
* Searching blocked usernames in block log is now clearer.
* Better timezone recognition in user preferences.
* Improved diff readability for colorblind people.
* The interwiki links table can now be accessed also when the interwiki cache is used (used in the API and the Interwiki extension).
* More gender support (for instance in logs and user lists).
* Language converter improved, e.g. it now works depending on the page content language.
* Time and number-formatting magic words also now depend on the page content language.
* Bidirectional support further improved after 1.18.

Report any [http://labs.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Problem_reports problems] on the labs beta wiki and we'll work to address them before they software is released to the production wikis.

'''Note''' that this cluster does have SUL but it is not integrated with SUL in production, so you'll need to create another account.  You should avoid using the same password as you use here.  — [[m:Global message delivery|Global message delivery]] 23:59, 14 UᏃᎸᏔᏂ 2012 (UTC)

== MediaWiki 1.19 ==

(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to upgrade MediaWiki (the software powering this wiki) to its latest version this month. You can help to test it before it is enabled, to avoid disruption and breakage. More information is available [[:mw:MediaWiki 1.19/Deployment announcement|in the full announcement]].

==Help us localise at least 65 MediaWiki messages==
One of the [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki] localisers found several errors in the MediaWiki localisation for Cherokee. These updates will not go live because the minimum number of 65 messages have not been localised. The question is therefore if someone of this community can help us and localise messages at translatewiki.net. 65 messages is the absolute requirement but it would be really great when the "[http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=core-0-mostused&language=chr most used messages]" are localised. This will have a really big impact on the users who prefer a user interface in Cherokee.<br/>

== Update on IPv6 ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it, as well as '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement on Meta]]''') 

The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to do limited testing of IPv6 on June 2-3. If there are not too many problems, we may fully enable IPv6 on [http://www.worldipv6day.org/ World IPv6 day] (June 6), and keep it enabled.

What this means for your project:

*At least on June 2-3, 2012, you may see a small number of edits from IPv6 addresses, which are in the form "<code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>". See e.g. [[w:en:IPv6 address]]. These addresses should behave like any other IP address: You can leave messages on their talk pages; you can track their contributions; you can block them. (See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] for notes on range blocks.)

*In the mid term, some user scripts and tools will need to be adapted for IPv6. 

*We suspect that IPv6 usage is going to be very low initially, meaning that abuse should be manageable, and we will assist in the monitoring of the situation.

Read [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] on how to test the behavior of IPv6 with various tools and how to leave bug reports, and to find a fuller analysis of the implications of the IPv6 migration.

Dear Wikimedians,

Wikimedia Commons is happy to announce that the ''2011 Picture of the Year competition'' is now open. We are interested in your opinion as to which images qualify to be the ''Picture of the Year 2011''. Any user registered at Commons or a Wikimedia wiki SUL-related to Commons [//toolserver.org/~pathoschild/accounteligibility/?user=&wiki=&event=24 with more than 75 edits before 1 April 2012 (UTC)] is welcome to vote and, of course everyone is welcome to view!

Detailed information about the contest can be found [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Introduction|at the introductory page]].

About 600 of the best of Wikimedia Common's photos, animations, movies and graphics were chosen &ndash;by the international Wikimedia Commons community&ndash; out of 12 million files during ''2011'' and are now called ''Featured Pictures''.

From professional animal and plant shots to breathtaking panoramas and skylines, restorations of historically relevant images, images portraying the world's best architecture, maps, emblems, diagrams created with the most modern technology, and impressive human portraits, Commons ''Features Pictures'' of all flavors.  

For your convenience, we have sorted the images [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Galleries|into topic categories]]. 

We regret that you receive this message in English; we intended to use banners to notify you in your native language but there was both, human and technical resistance.

See you on Commons!

== Help decide about more than $10 million of Wikimedia donations in the coming year ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
''(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it)''

Hi,

As many of you are aware, the Wikimedia Board of Trustees recently initiated important changes in the way that money is being distributed within the Wikimedia movement. As part of this, a new community-led "[[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC|Funds Dissemination Committee]]" (FDC) is currently being set up. Already in 2012-13, its recommendations will guide the decisions about the distribution of over 10 million US dollars among the Foundation, chapters and other [[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC#Eligible_fund-seeking_entities|eligible entities]].

Now, seven capable, knowledgeable and trustworthy community members are sought to volunteer on the initial Funds Dissemination Committee. It is expected to take up its work in September. In addition, a community member is sought to be the [[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC#FDC_Ombudsperson|Ombudsperson]] for the FDC process. If you are interested in joining the committee, read the [[m:Funds Dissemination Committee/Call for Volunteers|call for volunteers]]. Nominations are planned to close on August 15.

== More opportunities for you to access free research databases ==

The quest to get editors free access to the sources they need is gaining momentum.
* '''[[w:en:Wikipedia:Credo|Credo Reference]]''' provides full-text online versions of nearly 1200 published reference works from more than 70 publishers in every major subject, including general and subject dictionaries and encyclopedias.  There are '''125''' full Credo 350 accounts available, with access even to 100 more references works than in Credo's original donation.  All you need is a 1-year old account with 1000 edits.  Sign up [[w:en:Wikipedia:Credo#Sign-up sheet|here]].
* '''[[w:en:Wikipedia:HighBeam|HighBeam Research]]''' has access to over 80 million articles from 6,500 publications including newspapers, magazines, academic journals, newswires, trade magazines and encyclopedias.  Thousands of new articles are added daily, and archives date back over 25 years covering a wide range of subjects and industries.  There are '''250''' full access 1-year accounts available.  All you need is a 1-year old account with 1000 edits.  Sign up [[w:en:Wikipedia:HighBeam/Applications|here]].
* '''[[w:en:Wikipedia:Questia|Questia]]'''  is an online research library for books and journal articles focusing on the humanities and social sciences. Questia has curated titles from over 300 trusted publishers including 77,000 full-text books and 4 million journal, magazine, and newspaper articles, as well as encyclopedia entries.  There will soon be '''1000''' full access 1-year accounts available.  All you need is a 1-year old account with 1000 edits.  Sign up [[w:en:Wikipedia:Questia#Apply here: Round 1|here]].
You might also be interested in the idea to create a central '''Wikipedia Library''' where approved editors would have access to ''all'' participating resource donors.

== Wikidata is getting close to a first roll-out ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) 

As some of you might already have heard Wikimedia Deutschland is working on a new Wikimedia project. It is called [[m:Wikidata]]. The goal of Wikidata is to become a central data repository for the Wikipedias, its sister projects and the world. In the future it will hold data like the number of inhabitants of a country, the date of birth of a famous person or the length of a river. These can then be used in all Wikimedia projects and outside of them.

The project is divided into three phases and "we are getting close to roll-out the first phase". The phases are:
# language links in the Wikipedias (making it possible to store the links between the language editions of an article just once in Wikidata instead of in each linked article)
# infoboxes (making it possible to store the data that is currently in infoboxes in one central place and share the data)
# lists (making it possible to create lists and similar things based on queries to Wikidata so they update automatically when new data is added or modified)

It'd be great if you could join us, test the [http://wikidata-test.wikimedia.de demo version], provide feedback and take part in the development of Wikidata. You can find all the relevant information including an [[m:Wikidata/FAQ|FAQ]] and sign-up links for our on-wiki newsletter on [[m:Wikidata|the Wikidata page on Meta]]. 

For further discussions please use [[m:Talk:Wikidata|this talk page]] (if you are uncomfortable writing in English you can also write in your native language there) or point [[m:User_talk:Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)|me]] to the place where your discussion is happening so I can answer there.

== Fundraising localization: volunteers from outside the USA needed ==

''Please translate for your local community''

Hello All,

The Wikimedia Foundation's Fundraising team have begun our 'User Experience' project, with the goal of understanding the donation experience in different countries outside the USA and enhancing the localization of our donation pages. I am searching for volunteers to spend 30 minutes on a Skype chat with me, reviewing their own country's donation pages. It will be done on a 'usability' format (I will ask you to read the text and go through the donation flow) and will be asking your feedback in the meanwhile. 

The only pre-requisite is for the volunteer to actually live in the country and to have access to at least one donation method that we offer for that country (mainly credit/debit card, but also real-time banking like IDEAL, E-wallets, etc...) so we can do a live test and see if the donation goes through. ''All volunteers will be reimbursed of the donations that eventually succeed'' (and they will be low amounts, like 1-2 dollars)

By helping us you are actually helping thousands of people to support our mission of free knowledge across the world. Please sing up and help us with our 'User Experience' project! :)
If you are interested (or know of anyone who could be) please email ppena@wikimedia.org. All countries needed (excepting USA)!

Thanks!<br />

== Wikimedia sites to move to primary data center in Ashburn, Virginia. Read-only mode expected. ==

(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) Next week, the Wikimedia Foundation will transition its main technical operations to a new data center in Ashburn, Virginia, USA. This is intended to improve the technical performance and reliability of all Wikimedia sites, including this wiki. There will be some times when the site will be in read-only mode, and there may be full outages; the current target windows for the migration are January 22nd, 23rd and 24th, 2013, from 17:00 to 01:00 UTC (see [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Wikimedia+data+center+migration&iso=20130122T17&ah=8 other timezones] on timeanddate.com).

== Wikidata phase 1 (language links) coming to this Wikipedia ==

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this locally.

[[d:|Wikidata]] has been in development for a few months now. It is now time for the roll-out of the first part of it on your Wikipedia. Phase 1 is the support for the management of language links. It is already being used on the Hungarian, Hebrew, Italian and English Wikipedias. The next step is to enable the extension on all other Wikipedias. We have currently planned this for March 6.

=== What is Wikidata? ===
Wikidata is a central place to store data that you can usually find in infoboxes. Think of it as something like Wikimedia Commons but for data (like the number of inhabitants of a country or the length of a river) instead of multimedia. The first part of this project (centralizing language links) is being rolled out now. The more fancy things will follow later.

=== What is going to happen? ===
Language links in the sidebar are going to come from Wikidata in addition to the ones in the wiki text. To edit them, scroll to the bottom of the language links, and click edit. You no longer need to maintain these links by hand in the wiki text of the article.

=== Where can I find more information and ask questions? ===
Editors on en:wp have created a [[:en:Wikipedia:Wikidata|great page with all the necessary information for editors]] and there is also an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

=== I want to be kept up to date about Wikidata ===
To stay up-to-date on everything happening around Wikidata please [[meta:Global message delivery/Targets/Wikidata|subscribe]] to the newsletter that is delivered weekly to subscribed user’s talk pages. You can see previous editions [[meta:Wikidata/Newsletter/Archive|here]].

To edit them, scroll to the bottom of the language links, and click edit. You no longer need to maintain these links by hand in the wiki text of the article.

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
Editors on en:wp have created a [[:en:Wikipedia:Wikidata|great page with all the necessary information for editors]] and there is also an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. It'd be great if you could bring this to this wiki if that has not already happened. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

== Convert complex templates to Lua to make them faster and more powerful ==

<small>(Please consider translating this message for the benefit of your fellow Wikimedians)</small>

Greetings. As you might have seen on the [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/03/11/lua-templates-faster-more-flexible-pages/ Wikimedia tech blog] or the [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-ambassadors/2013-March/000171.html tech ambassadors list], a new functionality called "Lua" is being enabled on all Wikimedia sites today. [[mw:Lua|Lua]] is a scripting language that enables you to write faster and more powerful MediaWiki templates.

If you have questions about how to convert existing templates to Lua (or how to create new ones), we'll be holding two support sessions on IRC next week: [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=02&min=00&sec=0&day=20&month=03&year=2013 one on Wednesday] (for Oceania, Asia & America) and [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=18&min=00&sec=0&day=22&month=03&year=2013 one on Friday] (for Europe, Africa & America); see [[m:IRC office hours]] for the details. If you can't make it, you can also get help at [[mw:Talk:Lua scripting]].

If you'd like to learn about this kind of events earlier in advance, consider becoming a [[m:Tech/Ambassadors|Tech ambassador]] by subscribing to the [https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-ambassadors mailing list]. You will also be able to help your fellow Wikimedians have a voice in technical discussions and be notified of important decisions.

== Wikidata phase 2 (infoboxes) coming to this Wikipedia ==

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this. If you understand German better than English you can have a look at the announcement on [[:de:Wikipedia:Kurier]].

A while ago the first phase of [[d:|Wikidata]] was enabled on this Wikipedia. This means you are getting the language links in each article from Wikidata. It is soon time to enable the second phase of Wikidata (infoboxes) here. We have already done this on the [[http://blog.wikimedia.de/2013/03/27/you-can-have-all-the-data/ first 11 Wikipedias]] (it, he, hu, ru, tr, uk, uz, hr, bs, sr, sh) and things are looking good. The next step is English Wikipedia. This is planned for April 8. '''If everything works out fine we will deploy on all remaining Wikipedias on April 10.''' I will update [[m:Wikidata/Deployment Questions#When_will_this_be_deployed_on_my_Wikipedia.3F|this part of the FAQ]] if there are any issues forcing us to change this date. I will also sent another note to this village pump once the deployment is finished.

'''What will happen once we have phase 2 enabled here?'''
Once it is enabled in a few days you will be able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!)

'''How will this work?'''
There are two ways to access the data:
* Use a parser function like <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki> in the wiki text of the article on Yahoo!. This will return “[[d:Q14086|Marissa Mayer]]” as she is the [[d:Property:P169|chief executive officer]] of the [[d:Q37093|company]].
* For more complicated things you can use Lua. The documentation for this is [[mw:Extension:WikibaseClient/Lua|here]].

We are working on expanding the parser function so you can for example use <nowiki>{{#property:chief executive officer}}</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki>. The complete plan for this is [[meta:Wikidata/Notes/Inclusion syntax|here]].

'''Where can I test this?'''
You can already test it on [http://test2.wikipedia.org test2].

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
We have collected the main questions in an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

Hello!

There is [[m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|a new request for comment]] on Meta-Wiki concerning the removal of administrative rights from long-term inactive Wikimedians. Generally, this proposal from stewards would apply to wikis without an administrators' review process.

We are also compiling a [[m:Talk:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|list of projects]] with procedures for removing inactive administrators on the talk page of the request for comment. Feel free to add your project(s) to the list if you have a policy on administrator inactivity.

All input is appreciated. The discussion may close as soon as 21 May 2013 (2013-05-21), but this will be extended if needed.

Thanks, [[m:User:Billinghurst|Billinghurst]] <small>(thanks to all the [[m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders/Global message|translators]]!)</small> 04:24, 24 ᎧᏩᏂ 2013 (UTC)

Today all the remaining Wikipedias followed.

'''What does having phase 2 enabled here mean?'''
You are now able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!) The current state is just the beginning though. It will be extended based on feedback we get from you now.

'''How will this work?'''
There are two ways to access the data:
* Use a parser function like <nowiki>{{#property:p159}}</nowiki> in the wiki text of the article on Wikimedia Foundation. This will return “[[d:Q62|San Francisco]]” as that is the [[d:Property:P159|headquarter location]] of the [[d:180|non-profit]].
* For more complicated things you can use Lua. The documentation for this is [[mw:Extension:WikibaseClient/Lua|here]].

We are working on expanding the parser function so you can for example use <nowiki>{{#property:headquarter location}}</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>{{#property:p159}}</nowiki>. The complete plan for this is [[meta:Wikidata/Notes/Inclusion syntax|here]].

'''Where can I test this?'''
You can test it on [http://test2.wikipedia.org test2] if you don't want to do it in an article here.

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
We have collected the main questions in an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

To stay up-to-date on everything happening around Wikidata please [[meta:Global message delivery/Targets/Wikidata|subscribe]] to the newsletter that is delivered weekly to subscribed user’s talk pages.


We are excited about taking yet another step towards allowing all Wikipedias share structured data and collect and curate it together.

== [en] Change to section edit links ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr">
The default position of the "edit" link in page section headers is going to change soon. The "edit" link will be positioned adjacent to the page header text rather than floating opposite it.

Section edit links will be to the immediate right of section titles, instead of on the far right. If you're an editor of one of the wikis which already implemented this change, nothing will substantially change for you; however, scripts and gadgets depending on the previous implementation of section edit links will have to be adjusted to continue working; however, nothing else should break even if they are not updated in time.

[[m:Change to section edit links|Detailed information and a timeline]] is available on meta.

Ideas to do this all the way to 2009 at least. It is often difficult to track which of several potential section edit links on the far right is associated with the correct section, and many readers and anonymous or new editors may even be failing to notice section edit links at all, since they read section titles, which are far away from the links.

== VisualEditor and your Wikipedia ==

''(Please translate this message)''

Greetings,

The Wikimedia Foundation will soon turn on [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] for all users, all the time on your Wikipedia. Right now your Wikipedia does not have any local documents on VisualEditor, and we hope that your community can change that. To find out about how you can help with translations visit the [[mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|TranslationCentral for VisualEditor]] and read the easy instructions on [[mw:VisualEditor/Portal/Localization|bringing information to your Wikipedia]]. The [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|User Guide]] and the [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/FAQ|FAQ]] are very important to have in your language.
 
We want to find out as much as we can from you about VisualEditor and how it helps your Wikipedia, and having local pages is a great way to start. We also encourage you to [[mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|leave feedback on Mediawiki]] where the community can offer ideas, opinions, and point out bugs that may still exist in the software that need to be reported to [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=VisualEditor Bugzilla]. 
If you are able to speak for the concerns of others in English on MediaWiki or locally I encourage you to help your community to be represented in this process.

If you can help translate the user interface for VisualEditor to your language, you can help with that as well. [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc Translatewiki] has open tasks for translating VisualEditor. A direct link to translate the user interface is [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Special:Translate?filter=!translated&action=translate&group=ext-visualeditor here].

First, I’d like to apologize for the English. If you can, please help to translate this for other members of your community.

The legal team at the Wikimedia Foundation would greatly appreciate your input on the best way to manage the "community logo" (pictured here) to best balance protection of the projects with community support. Accordingly, they have created a “request for consultation” on Meta where they set out briefly some of the issues to be considered and the options that they perceive.

[[File:Notifications-Flyout-Screenshot-08-10-2013-Cropped.png|thumb|300px|Notifications inform you of new activity that affects you -- and let you take quick action.]]
''(This message is in English, please translate as needed)''

Greetings!  

[[mw:Echo|Notifications]] will inform users about new activity that affects them on this wiki in a unified way: for example, this new tool will let you know when you have new talk page messages, edit reverts, mentions or links -- and is designed to augment (rather than replace) the watchlist. The Wikimedia Foundation's editor engagement team developed this tool (code-named 'Echo') earlier this year, to help users contribute more productively to MediaWiki projects. 

We're now getting ready to bring Notifications to almost all other Wikimedia sites, and are aiming for a 22 October deployment, as outlined in [[mw:Echo/Release_Plan_2013|this release plan]]. It is important that notifications is translated for all of the languages we serve.  

There are three major points of translation needed to be either done or checked:
*[https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-echo#sortable:3=desc Echo on translatewiki for user interface] - you must have an account on translatewiki to translate
*[https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-thanks#sortable:3=desc Thanks on translatewiki for user interface] - you must have an account on translatewiki to translate
*[[mw:Help:Notifications|Notifications help on mediawiki.org]].  This page can be hosted after translation on mediawiki.org or we can localize it to this Wikipedia.  You do not have to have an account to translate on mediawiki, but single-user login will create it for you there if you follow the link.
:*[[mw:Echo/Release Plan 2013#Checklist|Checklist]]

Please let us know if you have any questions, suggestions or comments about this new tool. For more information, visit [[mw:Echo_(Notifications)|this project hub]] and [[mw:Help:Notifications|this help page]].

== Speak up about the trademark registration of the Community logo. ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hi all, 

Please join the consultation about the Community logo that represents Meta-Wiki: [[:m:Community Logo/Request for consultation]].

This community consultation was commenced on September 24. The following day, two individuals filed a legal opposition against the registration of the Community logo.

The question is whether the Wikimedia Foundation should seek a collective membership mark with respect to this logo or abandon its registration and protection of the trademark. 

We want to make sure that everyone get a chance to speak up so that we can get clear direction from the community.  We would therefore really appreciate the community's help in translating this announcement from English so that everyone is able to understand it.

== Introducting Beta Features ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''(Apologies for writing in English. Please translate if necessary)''

We would like to let you know about [[mw:About_Beta_Features|Beta Features]], a new program from the Wikimedia Foundation that lets you try out new features before they are released for everyone.

Think of it as a digital laboratory where community members can preview upcoming software and give feedback to help improve them. This special preference page lets designers and engineers experiment with new features on a broad scale, but in a way that's not disruptive.

Beta Features is now ready for testing on [[mw:Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|MediaWiki.org]]. It will also be released on Wikimedia Commons and MetaWiki this Thursday, 7 November. Based on test results, the plan is to release it on all wikis worldwide on 21 November, 2013.

Here are the first features you can test this week:
* [[mw:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|Media Viewer]] — view images in large size or full screen
* [[mw:VisualEditor/Beta_Features/Formulae|VisualEditor Formulæ]] (for wikis with [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]) — edit algebra or equations on your pages
* [[mw:Typography_Update|Typography Refresh]] —  make text more readable (coming Thursday)

Would you like to try out Beta Features now? After you log in on MediaWiki.org, a small 'Beta' link will appear next to your 'Preferences'. Click on it to see features you can test, check the ones you want, then click 'Save'. Learn more on the [[mw:About_Beta_Features|Beta Features page]].

After you've tested Beta Features, please let the developers know what you think on [[mw:Talk:About_Beta_Features|this discussion page]] -- or report any bugs [http://wmbug.com/new?product=MediaWiki%20extensions&component=BetaFeatures here on Bugzilla]. You're also welcome to join [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|this IRC office hours chat]] on Friday, 8 November at 18:30 UTC. 

Beta Features was developed by the Wikimedia Foundation's Design, Multimedia and VisualEditor teams. Along with other developers, they will be adding new features to this experimental program every few weeks. They are very grateful to all the community members who helped create this project — and look forward to many more productive collaborations in the future.

Enjoy, and don't forget to let developers know what you think!  [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 19:35, 5 ᏄᏓᏕᏆ 2013 (UTC)

== Call for comments on draft trademark policy ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hi all, 

The Wikimedia legal team invites you to participate in the development of the new Wikimedia trademark policy.

The [[:wmf:Trademark policy|current trademark policy]] was introduced in 2009 to protect the [[:wmf:Wikimedia trademarks|Wikimedia marks]]. We are now updating this policy to better balance permissive use of the marks with the legal requirements for preserving them for the community. The new draft trademark policy is ready for your review [[:m:Trademark policy|here]], and we encourage you to discuss it [[:m:Talk:Trademark policy|here]].

We would appreciate if someone would translate this message into your language so more members of your community can contribute to the conversation.

== IMPORTANT: Admin activity review == 
Hello. A new policy regarding the removal of "advanced rights" (administrator, bureaucrat, etc) was recently adopted by [[:m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|global community consensus]] (your community received a notice about the discussion). According to this policy, the [[:m:stewards|stewards]] are reviewing administrators' activity on smaller wikis. To the best of our knowledge, your wiki does not have a formal process for removing "advanced rights" from inactive accounts. This means that the stewards will take care of this according to the new [[:m:Admin activity review|admin activity review]] here.


We have determined that the following users meet the inactivity criteria (no edits and no log actions for more than 2 years):
#Etse (administrator)
#Gmaxwell (administrator)

These users will receive a notification soon, asking them to start a community discussion if they want to retain some or all of their rights. If the users do not respond, then their advanced rights will be removed by the stewards.

However, if you as a community would like to create your own activity review process superseding the global one, want to make another decision about these inactive rights holders, or already have a policy that we missed, then please notify the [[:m:Stewards' noticeboard|stewards on Meta-Wiki]] so that we know not to proceed with the rights review on your wiki.

==Please test VisualEditor in your language==
<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|right|frameless]]
It is very important to us at the [[:mw:Editing|Editing Department]] that [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Portal|VisualEditor]] works in every language, for every user.

VisualEditor's editing environment is a browser ContentEditable element. This means that your [[:en:Input method|input method editor]] (IME) should already know how to work with it. However, to make VisualEditor correctly edit wiki pages, we have to stop browsers in lots of ways from breaking the page.

Sometimes this can interfere with IMEs. To make sure we work in your IME, we need your help: please see '''[http://wikimedia.github.io/VisualEditor/demos/ve/desktop-dist.html#!pages/simple.html wikimedia.github.io/VisualEditor/demos/ve/desktop-dist.html#!pages/simple.html]'''. This is the core system inside VisualEditor which lets you write and edit. It is different from the full editor, and some of the tools you are used to will be missing.

We're interested in particular in whether you can write text at all, what happens when you select different candidate texts, and how VisualEditor behaves in general.

More details, and some early test results, are provided here: '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/IME_Testing#What_to_test|mediawiki.org/wiki/VisualEditor/IME_Testing#What_to_test]]'''.

We would love to hear from every language, and especially languages which use IMEs, like Japanese, Korean, Indic languages, Arabic and others. Thank you for your help.

# Please enable the Beta feature in your preferences and check the box for Content Translation. 
# Visit the page [[Special:ContentTranslation]] or to your contributions page to open the tool. 
# Click on the blue button to create a new translation. 
# A dialog will be displayed. In the From section select the language of the original article and the article name, and the language you would like to translate to. Also add the title of the new article (or the original title will be inserted) and click on Translate to begin. Your language preferences will be remembered for the next time. 
# You will see a screen consisting of three columns. The left column contains the text of the source language and the middle column is for the translated text. Using the right column you can perform several actions such as insert source text, remove the inserted text source text, add or remove links etc.  
# After you translate the article, you can publish it directly as a new page on the Cherokee Wikipedia by using the publish button that appears. In case the article gets created by another user while you  were translating, you will see an option to save the newly published translation under your user namespace.  
# The number of published pages can be seen on the [[Special:CXStats|Content Translation stats page]]. 

Since, this is the first time we have installed the tool on this Wikipedia, there are chances that there may be some problems or service disruptions which we are not yet aware of.

==Wikipedia to the Moon working phase==

Dear Chereokee Wikipedia language community,

First of all, I am sorry to write this in English. 

You may already have heard about [[:meta:Wikipdia_to_the_Moon|Wikipedia to the Moon]]: A team of scientists called the “PT Scientists” are going to send a space craft to the moon in 2017 and they want to take Wikipedia along with them. Because Wikipedia is so big, we cannot send all of it to the moon. That is why the international Wikipedia-community has voted to send all “Featured Articles and Featured Lists“ from all languages in Wikipedia.

[[:en:Wikipedia:Featured_articles|“Featured Articles“]] is a category in many language versions of Wikipedia that collects the very best articles in that language. Your community does not currently have a „Featured Articles“ category. Ideally, we want to take every language on Wikipedia to the moon and we also want to take the best articles in your language. That is why we would like ''you'' to tell us what the very best articles in your language are.

There are two ways you could do this:

:1) You could introduce the categories “Featured Article” and “Featured List” in your language version of Wikipedia and vote for the best articles and put them in the category. We will take every article that is tagged as a “Featured Article” or a “Featured List” to the moon

:2) You could vote for the best articles in your language version of Wikipedia and put them all on one a new Wikipedia page. If you let us know where we can find that list [[:meta:Wikipedia_to_the_Moon/Working|here]], we will also take the articles to the moon.

The deadline for Wikipedia to the Moon is 31 October 2016. After that date, we will put all the Featured Articles and Lists onto a special disc and give it to the “PT Scientists.” They will take the Wikipedia articles into space next year.

It allows people to edit articles as if they were using a typical word processor. Here's a quick explanation of what is going to happen''': you can find a more detailed one, with pictures, at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Single_edit_tab|mediawiki.org]]. 

[[File:VisualEditor and wikitext side-by-side.png|alt=Side by side screenshots, showing the visual appearance of both editing systems |center|frameless|720px]]

;What's changing?
:In the new system, you get a <u>single edit tab which follows your preferences</u>, and that therefore will launch the wikitext editor '''or''' the visual editor depending on which one you opened the last (''{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-remember-last}}''). <br> This applies to everyone who edited recently, including anonymous users.
;How do I switch to the ''other'' editor then?
:Buttons on the toolbars of both editors were added months ago so that you can switch from one to the other every time you want to, without losing your changes and without having to save first. <br>The button, located on the right side of the toolbar, looks like square brackets ('''<nowiki>[[ ]]</nowiki>''') in the visual editor, and like a pencil ([[File:OOjs UI icon edit-ltr.svg|20px]]) in the wikitext editor.

;Are there other options available?
:Yes. You can choose whether you want:
* ''{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}}'' (if you temporarily switch to the wikitext editor through the button on the toolbar, the system won't remember it; also, it only applies to namespaces where the visual editor is available).
* ''{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}'' (if you temporarily switch to the visual editor through the button on the toolbar, the system won't remember it)
* ''{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}'' (a system in place at multiple wikis since 2013. You are familiar with this option if you have been using the visual editor here.)
**''Please note: all the users will always have the opportunity to switch to the other editor via buttons on the toolbars, for occasional edits''.

;How do I set my preference?
*If you want to try or to stay in the new system: you don't need to do anything.
*If you had explicitly disabled the visual editor in the past and want to keep it disabled: you don't need to do anything.
*All the registered users have a dropdown menu in the [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing|Editing tab of their Preferences]] ({{int:prefs-editing}} --> {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs}}), where they can choose from. <u>This only needs to be done once</u>. Don't forget to save ;)
**<small>Users with the visual editor disabled need to re-enable it if they're interested in accessing that menu!</small>
*People who use the visual editor regularly will see a pop-up <u>(only once after the single edit tab system is introduced)</u>, and they can choose their favorite setting there. Of course, they can change their mind at any time just like the others, and pick a different setting from their Preferences.
**Anonymous users who have used the visual editor recently will also be able to choose which editor they want to edit with.
**''Reminder: all the users will always have the opportunity to switch to the other editor via buttons on the toolbars, for occasional edits''.

;Final remarks
*<mark>Please spread the word about this major change</mark> in any way that you deem appropriate for this community, by linking to this announcement elsewhere, putting up a site notice, etc. Please note it will affect all the registered users at first, and after some days it will reach logged-out contributors as well if no major technical issues have arisen. Don't hesitate to ask questions, I'll be around for a while to help! 
*Please do let us know about any anomalies you think you're experiencing, and do post any other feedback below. I'd like to thank everyone who works to make the transition easier for this community, and whoever will help me processing feedback in your language. 
*You can learn more about optimizing the visual editor experience here by [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/VE_as_the_main_editor|reading a guide on mediawiki.org]].

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has mainly worked on a new wikitext editor.  They have also released some small features and the new map editing tool.  Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the list of work finished each week at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, releasing the 2017 wikitext editor as a [[mediawikiwiki:Beta_Features|beta feature]], and improving language support.

=== Recent changes ===

*You can now set text as small or big.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T53613] 
*Invisible templates have been shown as a puzzle icon.  Now, the name of the invisible template is displayed next to the puzzle icon.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T141861]  A similar feature will display the first part of hidden HTML comments.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T147089]
*Categories are displayed at the bottom of each page.  If you click on the categories, the dialog for editing categories will open.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T145267]
*At many wikis, you can now add [[mediawikiwiki:Maps|maps]] to pages.  Go to the Insert menu and choose the "Maps" item. The Discovery department is adding more features to this area, like geoshapes. You can read more at mediawiki.org.[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Discovery#Maps]
*The "Save" button now says "Save page" when you create a page, and "Save changes" when you change an existing page.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T139033]  In the future, the "{{int:Savearticle}}" button will say "{{int:Publishpage}}".  This will affect both the visual and wikitext editing systems.  More [[:m:Editing/Publish|information is available on Meta]].
*Image galleries now use a visual mode for editing.  You can see thumbnails of the images, add new files, remove unwanted images, rearrange the images by dragging and dropping, and add captions for each image.  Use the "Options" tab to set the gallery's display mode, image sizes, and add a title for the gallery.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T45037]

=== Future changes ===

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the remaining 10 [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next month. The developers want to know whether typing in your language feels natural in the visual editor.  Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]]. This will affect several languages, including [[:w:th:|'''Thai''']], [[:w:my:|'''Burmese''']] and [[:w:arc:|'''Aramaic''']].

The team is working on a modern wikitext editor.  The [[Mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]] will look like the visual editor and be able to use the citoid service and other modern tools.  This new editing system may become available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices in October 2016.  You can read about this project in a [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Roadmap/Update_2016-06-23|general status update on the Wikimedia mailing list]]. 

=== Let's work together ===

* Do you teach new editors how to use the visual editor? Did you help [[:mw:Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|set up the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki]]? Have you written or imported [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your most important citation templates?  <mark>Would you be willing to help new editors and small communities with the visual editor?  Please sign up for the new [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/Community Taskforce|'''VisualEditor Community Taskforce''']].</mark>

== [[m:Requests for comment/Global centralnotice for the blockade of the Turkish government]] ==
Hi, you are invited to participate in the discussion on the proposal to make a banner through [[m: centralnotice]] to inform more people around the world about what the Turkish government has done about Wikipedia, ie all the language versions of Wikipedia are You are obscured, so in Turkey it is impossible to view the * .wikipedia.org site. To hope that the Turkish government will remove the block, it is necessary to raise awareness of this fact around the world because it is important to succeed in this mission because Wikipedia can not be seen in Turkey. With this message also for those interested, I invite him to sign the [[m:Response to 2017 ban in Turkey|Wikimedian appeal]].

If you have any questions or questions do not hesitate to contact me.

== Administrator flag's ==

Hi! I request that the temporary administrator flag be assigned to help fight vandalism and delete pages created only as a test or vandalism. The flag I would use so you can delete as soon as possible these pages to improve Wiktionary. I am global rolback and member of [[m:SWMT]] as well as administrators in various projects. If there are no oppositions in a week, I will make a request for a target for the flag. I always wrote here my request to renew the flag so if someone is against it, I must write it here. 

Thanks and regards. -- [[User:Samuele2002|Samuele2002]] ([[User talk:Samuele2002|talk]]) 16:57, 6 ᏕᎭᎷᏱ 2017 (UTC)

== presenting the project Wikipedia Cultural Diversity Observatory and asking for a vounteer in Cherokee Wikipedia ==
Hello everyone,

My name is Marc Miquel and I am a researcher from Barcelona (Universitat Pompeu Fabra). While I was doing my PhD I studied whether an identity-based motivation could be important for editor participation and I analyzed content representing the editors' cultural context in 40 Wikipedia language editions. Few months later, I propose creating the <nowiki>'''</nowiki>Wikipedia Cultural Diversity Observatory<nowiki>'''</nowiki> in order to raise awareness on Wikipedia’s current state of cultural diversity, providing datasets, visualizations and statistics, and pointing out solutions to improve intercultural coverage. 

I am presenting this project to a grant and I expect that the site becomes a useful tool to help communities create more multicultural encyclopaedias and bridge the content culture gap that exists across language editions (one particular type of systemic bias). For instance, this would help spreading cultural content local to Cherokee Wikipedia into the rest of Wikipedia language editions, and viceversa, make Cherokee Wikipedia much more multicultural.

Here is the link of the project proposal:

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Wikipedia_Cultural_Diversity_Observatory_(WCDO)

I am searching for a volunteer in each language community: I still need one for the Cherokee Wikipedia. If you feel like it, you can contact me at: marcmiquel *at* gmail.com I need a contact in your every community who can (1) check the quality of the cultural context article list I generate to be imported-exported to other language editions, (2) test the interface/data visualizations in their language, and (3) communicate the existance of the tool/site when ready to the language community and especially to those editors involved in projects which could use it or be aligned with it. Communicating it might not be a lot of work, but it will surely have a greater impact if done in native language! :). <nowiki>'''</nowiki>If you like the project, I'd ask you to endorse it in the page I provided.<nowiki>'''</nowiki> In any case, I will appreciate any feedback, comments,... Thanks in advance for your time! Best regards, Marc Miquel --[[User:Marcmiquel|Marcmiquel]] ([[User talk:Marcmiquel|talk]]) 08:41, 10 ᏚᏂᏅᏗ 2017 (UTC) Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona
