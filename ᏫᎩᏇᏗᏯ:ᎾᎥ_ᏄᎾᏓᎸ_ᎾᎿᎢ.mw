==Ideas to aggressively delete or mostly blank poor-quality entries==
I am currently streaming a video conference about the Cherokee language and language-revitalization efforts from Western Carolina University's Cherokee Language program[https://www.facebook.com/WCUCherokeeLanguage/] where Dr. Hartwell Francis, the former director, is speaking. To paraphrase him, he stated that the Cherokee-language community has been aware of this project for a decade, but that many of the current Wikipedia articles are of remarkably poor quality because of the influence of bot-generated entries. This makes even looking at them incredibly demotivating because the challenge of fixing them is so daunting. Thus, he suggests cleaning up the project and perhaps revitalizing it through aggressive deleting of low-quality entries. 

A possible alternative to mass deletion might be mass partial blanking to encourage more human-created edits. A poor quality article could be reduced to some boiler-plate text like "XXX is in need of an article" or "XXX had the previous article replaced with this text because it was poor-quality, but please feel free to begin a new article now", but in Cherokee. I am not a Cherokee-speaker, but I could help make these edits (or teach someone else to) if a boiler-plate text and a list of the low-quality demotivating entries were provided. I plan to notify Dr. Hartwell Francis about this thread, and let him know that I believe an bold approach like this is warranted (and feasible) in order to deal with what appears like a stagnant project. Any ideas? [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 16:00, 26 ᎠᏄᏱ 2018 (UTC)

:If partial blanking or mass deletion of those pages results in more activity from native (or at least fluent) speakers, I have no objections :) Although I believe pages like [[ᏅᏃᎯ]] are also important to look at, as they seem to be bot generated articles which are not fully translated and probably incorrectly as well. --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 16:35, 26 ᎠᏄᏱ 2018 (UTC)
::Thanks for the reply Ooswesthoesbes. For ᏅᏃᎯ, yes, I'd guess, just based on hearing people talk about Cherokee Wikipedia, that a lot is probably incorrectly translated. The concept of turning articles into much shorter versions of themselves ("stubs") should also be considered. (For reference, on English Wikipedia the concept is referred to as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub#Stubbing_existing_articles "stubifying"].) If a couple sentences of useful content can be preserved or generated, then massively chopping a gargantuan poor-quality article down to a factual sentence or short paragraph is also a significant improvement.

Thanks [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] for starting this conversation and [[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] and [[User:Seb az86556|Seb az86556]] for providing context and clarification on the machine translation debacle. I see that editor was banned from Wikipedia a decade ago. 

I also gave some remarks at the symposium at Western Carolina (I'm Derek). I think there would be interest in organizing an edit-a-thon out at Western Carolina, and hopefully we could get some of the fluent speakers to attend along with advanced learners. It would be great if, in preparation, we could clean all the garbage articles out. I like the idea of blanking them with boilerplate. It would be nice if there was a bot to do this, but if there are just a few hundred articles, we could probably get it done manually? I'm not a speaker, but could coordinate the translation of the boilerplate or template by a fluent speaker.

What else should we be considering if we wanted to reboot this project with an edit-a-thon? --[[User:R12ntech|R12ntech]] ([[User talk:R12ntech|talk]]) 18:24, 9 ᎧᏩᏂ 2018 (UTC)

In the past, language editions such as Chamorro, Dzongkha, Sango, Venda, Kirundi, Inupiak, Inuktitut, Xitsonga were all proposed by various users for '''Closure''' due to the low number of articles and no native speakers contributing, Language projects that were closed down (ie. locked down) include Ndonga, Choctaw, Kuanyama, Marshallese, Hiri Motu, Afar and Muscogee.
:::::::Even Zulu wikipedia was proposed for closure in the past, now would anyone even think of closing Zulu Wikipedia? 
Mass deletion/blanking of pages will not result in a revival of Cherokee wikipedia, it would result in its continued stagnation and attract zero native speakers to edit here.
Imagine if all the stubs of Kashmiri Wikipedia were deleted right now, would a flood of Kashmiris start editing there?  Highly unlikely.

==Random thoughts for someone knowledgeable about Cherokee==

*I searched for [[ᎠᎹᏍᎧᎦᎯ]] at cherokeedictionary.net but there were no hits. I noticed that one source defined a waterfall as ᎠᎹ ᎦᏙᎣᏍᎬᎢ, but I believe that was derived from a self-published source, for what it's worth. I wonder if it is an incorrect title. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 10:14, 2 ᎧᏩᏂ 2018 (UTC)
**That website didn't have a definition for badger, so it's not as comprehensive as I was hoping, for what it's worth. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 16:56, 2 ᎧᏩᏂ 2018 (UTC)
***When the ancient Cherokee saw waterfalls I am sure they believed them to be mystical. ᎠᎹ ᎦᏙᎣᏍᎬᎢ refers to nothing that I can find or have been taught. However, it may be derived from an "overfill of water", "absess or abundance of water", or even a "flood". What I do know is the Cherokee held, and for some still do hold, that water has a Spiritual connection to us and therefore the word(s) for waterfall have other meanings. ᎠᎹᏍᎧᎦᎯ means "waterfall" but also a name for "Water Spirits". ᎠᏥᎳᏗᏰᎯ, another word for "waterfall", also is a name given for the "Will o' the Wisp" which we now know to be the phenomenon when gases are released from a swamp and produce a light like a floating orb but to the ancient Cherokee would be seen as having Spirit connections. --[[User:Tsistunagiska|Tsistunagiska]] ([[User talk:Tsistunagiska|talk]]) 14:51, 4 ᎦᎶᏂᎢ 2020 (UTC)

*****Yes. Why do you ask about that? ᎠᎵᏏᏅᏙᏗ is given as economy in the Noquisis word list, for what it's worth. And I'm assuming a bit that ᎠᎾᎵᏏᎾᎯᏍᏗᏍᎩ means economics anyhow, from context.

*******@[[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]]@[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] I hope tagging you both is ok. Biosthmors is correct in the dialectal differences. The Eastern or Kituwah dialect uses "ts" in place of the more widely used "tl" in the Western or Overhill dialect. These differences are not only found in written but also spoken Cherokee. "Ts" in the Western dialect is spoken as a soft "J" as in jaw. At any rate, ᎠᎾᎵᏏᏀᎢᏍᏗᏍᎩ is most often used for "economics" while ᎠᎵᏏᏅᏙ is used for "economy". For what it is worth, Economic is ᎠᎳᏏᏅᏙᏗ while Economical is ᎠᎳᏏᎾᎯᏍᏗ, respectively. --[[User:Tsistunagiska|Tsistunagiska]] ([[User talk:Tsistunagiska|talk]]) 16:22, 4 ᎦᎶᏂᎢ 2020 (UTC)

**The word "ᎠᎾᎵᏏᏀᎢᏍᏗᏍᎩ" appears to be the result of a bad transliteration conversion. It transliterates to "analisinahisdisgi". The word "ᎠᎾᎵᏏᎾᎯᏍᏗᏍᎩ" also transliterates to analisinahisdisgi.

Flower (ᎠᏥᎸᏍᎩ) is a fundamental topic that should exist as a red link until a standalone article is created, in my opinion. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 02:19, 25 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2018 (UTC)
:Agreed :) --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 09:29, 25 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2018 (UTC)
::I would leave this as is. ᎠᏥᎸᏍᎩ is used for "flowers". I have seen ᎠᏂᎠᏥᎳᏍ used for "flowers" too. Flower(singular) is most often spelled ᎠᏥᎸᏍᎩ(blossom) or ᎱᏥᎸᎭ but I have even seen it shortened to ᎠᏥᎳᏍ or ᏥᎳ. Rose could be my namesake, ᏥᏍᏚᎾᎩᏍᎧ(Wild Rose), or both ᎠᏥᎸᏍᎩ(plural) and ᎠᏥᎸᏍᎩ(singular), respectively. I have seen ᎠᏥᎸᏍᎩ used to refer to orchid before. --[[User:Tsistunagiska|Tsistunagiska]] ([[User talk:Tsistunagiska|talk]]) 12:39, 4 ᎦᎶᏂᎢ 2020 (UTC)

I marked [[ᎠᏓᏍᏕᎸᏗ]] with <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki>. It took me longer than usual to get a decent idea about what's the topic of the article. The online dictionary gives definitions of aid, charity, rescue, assist, protect, intercede, and relief for the term. Wikidata thinks it's about the Great Commandment. One reason I'm of the opinion to delete is because there isn't an apparent lead section/first sentence to orient readers. (''ᎧᏁᏨ'' means word so I'm guessing that first section is about etymology?) For what it's worth, [[:en:w:Charity (virtue)]] and [[:en:w:Charity (practice)]] are separate topics on English Wikipedia. It seems charity is the topic of the article. There have been no significant edits to the article in the last 12 years, only minor changes from Roman letters into the Cherokee syllabary since the machine-translated data dump. It just seems better to delete this one to me. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 17:56, 29 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2018 (UTC)
:Done. --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 12:27, 30 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2018 (UTC)
::I did not get to see the content of the article prior to deletion but if it was not depicting the act of offering aid, charity, assistance, protection or intercession or the action of rescuing then it was probably incorrectly attributed.

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎪᎱᏍᏗ ᎬᏔᏂᏓᏍᏗ]]. This machine-translated article is intended to be about tools. However, the term ᎪᎱᏍᏗ ᎬᏔᏂᏓᏍᏗ is defined as instruments in the Cherokee online dictionary. (Another term is used for tools.) It appears this article is so bad that it can't even get the title right. We might as well scrap it. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 13:31, 8 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)
:ᎪᎱᏍᏗᎬᏔᏂᏓᏍᏗ does mean "instrument" but can also refer to a "tool" to complete a task. When referring to "tools"(plural) then ᎪᎱᏍᏗᏗᎬᏔᏂᏓᏍᏗ is used. --[[User:Tsistunagiska|Tsistunagiska]] ([[User talk:Tsistunagiska|talk]]) 13:00, 4 ᎦᎶᏂᎢ 2020 (UTC)

Similarly, I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᏁᎵᏒ]]. It is supposed to be about thought, but the dictionary defines it as assumed. Another word is given for thought. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 23:34, 12 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)

And I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᏕᎦᏃᏣᎸ]] because it is machine-translated to be about telegraphy, but the dictionary defines ᏕᎦᏃᏣᎸ as publication.

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎦᎸᎳᏗᏦᏒ ᎠᏓᏅᏒ ᏧᎾᏁᎶᏗᎢ]] with the following rationale: One can see the discussion at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Heaven_Sent_Gaming for example. I would suspect this article was established for promotional purposes. It's just not important enough for an article here. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 19:54, 20 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC)

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎧᎹᎹ ᎤᏔᎾ]]. The article is about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae but we don't even have an article on elephant at the moment here. This topic is just too technical to be useful at this point in time on this project, in my opinion. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 20:00, 20 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC)

Similarly, I placed on <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᏏᏆᎤᏤᏣᏍᏗ]] as it's also a technical biological concept ( https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6584653 ). I went ahead and deleted the link back to that Cherokee article on Wikidata. I also went ahead and created an article on opossum with a picture ([[ᏏᏆ ᎤᏤᏥᏍᏗ]]), since we didn't previously have one. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 21:57, 20 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC) 

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[Zemeros flegyas]]. It's an Asian species of butterfly, and I don't see how there would be a Cherokee word for it. There were no hits when searching for the English word "Zemeros" in the Cherokee online dictionary. Honestly, I don't see why we should host obscure articles here that have no conceivable connection to the Cherokee language. I feel like this encyclopedia needs to prioritize things that are relevant in Cherokee if we are to attract those wishing to preserve and revitalize the language. Any article we host here, in my opinion, is an implicit request for contributions from those with Cherokee knowledge. And since Cherokee is endangered, and that resource (Cherokee knowledge) is exceedingly scarce, I feel like we should be mindful of that and typically only host relevant concepts or things of general interest to a global population. (A random Polish town or village would not qualify, for example. I recall seeing those on this site.) For examples of relevant concepts in Cherokee, [https://cherokee.org/About-The-Nation/Cherokee-Language/Downloads this link] shows files with terms for animals, insects, and plants that are documented on the Cherokee Nation website.

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎠᏣᏅᏙ]]. This word is defined as ''ornament'', and despite that, this title used to host the article on plasma, which has been moved and is now at [[ᎩᎦ ᎤᎸᏌᏓ]]. An inappropriate redirect remains. Thanks.

I placed on <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[Ayyavazhi]]. It is a Hindu denomination of 8 to 10 million people according to the English Wikipedia. One day when there's an article on Hinduism (one doesn't currently exists according to Wikidata) perhaps it can be mentioned there. This topic is too specialized for this project's purposes at this moment. When so many things that do have Cherokee words for them aren't covered here I just don't see the point. The same goes for [[Carl Menger]]. Perhaps he could be mentioned on an economics article should one be written. I placed the delete template there as well. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 23:39, 29 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC)

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on the redirect [[ᎠᏬᎭᎵ]]. It redirects to the concept of eagle, however it appears that this redirect is main word for eagle according to a dictionary search.

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎢᏃᎵ]]. It is currently linked to Wikidata as the American badger. However, I can't find a word for badger on the online dictionary. There also isn't a word for badger on the Cherokee Nation poster of animals.[https://cherokee.org/Portals/cherokeeorg/Language/Animals%2016x20%20(Reduced).pdf?ver=2019-03-06-124700-100] However, I did find the word ''ᎢᏃᎵ'' on the Consortium Word List, which says it means "black fox". After looking that up it might refer to a historical person as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Fox_(Cherokee_chief) or to an animal as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_fox_(animal) , or both concepts perhaps. I propose deleting it for now as it appears we have it wrong for the moment. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 20:19, 13 ᏕᎭᎷᏱ 2019 (UTC)

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎬᏂᎨᏧᎵ]]. I couldn't find any evidence that this was the correct word for the red fox. For what it's worth, [[ᏧᎵ]] is the accepted word for fox according to the Cherokee Nation poster of animals. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 20:28, 13 ᏕᎭᎷᏱ 2019 (UTC)
:[[ᏧᎳ]] seems to be the current entry on fox for what it's worth. Maybe ᏧᎳ and ᏧᎵ are synonyms. To be determined. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 17:45, 14 ᏕᎭᎷᏱ 2019 (UTC)
:The Cherokee Nation word list[https://cherokee.org/About-The-Nation/Cherokee-Language/Dikaneisdi-Word-List] gives ᏧᎳ for fox. Interesting. The Raven Rock/Eastern dialect dictionary gives ᏧᎳ ᎩᎦᎨ for the red fox. Both the Noquisis word list and the Raven Rock Dictionary give ᏧᎳ for fox, so with three sources I think it's safe to say ᏧᎳ is the predominant word for fox. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 17:19, 20 ᏕᎭᎷᏱ 2019 (UTC)
::ᎬᏂᎨ is described as "the color of death" which also refers to black and used in many names of animals such as black bear (ᎬᏂᎨᏲᎾ). ᎩᎦᎨ is the color of red. ᏧᎵ may refer to the plural of fox and therefore when speaking of the entire species of black fox you may refer to it as ᎬᏂᎨᏧᎵ. ᏧᎵ also appears in words like ᏧᎵᎬᏩᎳᏅᎯ which means "process". To your later point, ᏧᎳ is also accepted as the written word for "fox" but may refer to a single fox. That would justify the differences between what is written in the above mentioned poster and the words you located in the dictionaries. It could also be differences in the dialects as I am studying the Western Dialect, which is more commonly used. ᎢᏃᎵ does refer to Chief Blackfox of the Cherokee and not the animal.--[[User:Tsistunagiska|Tsistunagiska]] ([[User talk:Tsistunagiska|talk]]) 20:32, 3 ᎦᎶᏂᎢ 2020 (UTC)

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᏗᏂᏃᎨᏂ]] because the dictionary says it is defined as "arms" but right now it is tied to the concept of rifle via Wikidata. When you go to the dictionary to search for arm, then you see that ᏗᎧᏃᎨᏂ is the NC medical definition for arms. And ᎦᏃᎨᏂ is given as the term for his arm. Given that all of these words have ''ᏃᎨᏂ'' in them, I suspect this is a biological term, and not one for armaments. Given the ambiguity, and the fact there's no real content, I say we should just delete it. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 20:34, 15 ᏕᎭᎷᏱ 2019 (UTC)

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[Ꮄꭲꮹ]]. It appears someone interested in Japanese culture added the article, but it isn't a Cherokee word I think it's safe to assume. If we're proven wrong later, the article can be recreated. I also placed the delete template on [[Ꮌꮩ Ꭶꭰꮚꭱꮎ Ꮙꮚꮎ Ꮤꮳ]] as it is something relevant in Japanese but not in Cherokee, I presume. Ethnologue says ~1500 people speak Cherokee right now. I imagine they are talking about something else in Cherokee than random things that are concepts in Japanese.

I don't know how we can make sure this is the right word. For what it's worth, the google definition says that antelope are African and/or Asian, so I'm not sure a Cherokee word for them even exists. And as an aside, specific Cherokee words for [https://cherokee.org/Portals/cherokeeorg/Language/Birds.pdf bird species] abound. I'm guessing we're missing a lot of those articles.

== Multilingual Shared Templates and Modules ==
Hello chr-wiki community! ({{int:please-translate}})

I recently organized a project to share templates and modules between wikis. It allows modules and templates to be “language-neutral”, and store all text translations on Commons. This means that it is enough to copy/paste a template without any changes, and update the translations separately. If someone fixes a bug or adds a new feature in the original module, you can copy/paste it again without any translation work. My bot ''DiBabelYurikBot'' can help with copying. This way users can spend more time on content, and less time on updating and copying templates. Please see [[mw:WP:TNT|project page]] for details and ask questions on talk page.

P.S. I am [[meta:Affiliate-selected_Board_seats/2019/Nominations/Yuri_Astrakhan_(yurik)|currently running]] for the Wikimedia board, focusing on content and support of multi-language communities. If you liked my projects like maps, graphs, or this one, I will be happy to receive your support. (any [[meta:Affiliate-selected_Board_seats/2019/Eligible_entities|registered user group]] can vote). Thank you! --[[User:Yurik|Yurik]] ([[meta:User talk:Yurik|talk]]) 05:59, 11 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC)

== Question ==

Hello all! I'm Jonathan. I'm an editor on the English Wikipedia, but this is my first time here on the Cherokee Wikipedia. Nice to meet everyone!
I was wondering if anyone is still trying to revive this wiki. If so, who's still here? What's being done? Is there any way I could help?
I live in North Carolina, so I thought maybe I could try to get in touch with local Cherokee. I don't have any personal relations to the Cherokee people, and don't speak Cherokee, but after reading that Cherokee is on the verge of becoming extinct I was hoping I could help out in some way... 
Does anyone know of any good Cherokee language learning materials? Are any Cherokee speakers currently working on this wiki? What are some topics that need articles? Are there any decent translation tools from languages with many good articles into Cherokee? What are some of the best existing articles on this wiki?
Might it make sense to try to write some decent articles in English about topics that are relevant to the Cherokee people, and then try to translate them into Cherokee? 
Here are some topics that I think might be relevant:
* anything about the Cherokee language
* Cherokee ceremonies, rituals, etc
* Modern Cherokee people (the various tribes, areas with significant Cherokee populations, etc)
* Cherokee schools, immersion programs
* important Cherokee literature
* Cherokee language learning materials (maybe have a section in the wiki that provides links to such materials)? My idea is to help anyone who is interested learn enough Cherokee to be able to write basic articles for this wiki.
If there's anything I can do to help out, let me know! [[User:JonathanHopeThisIsUnique|JonathanHopeThisIsUnique]] ([[User talk:JonathanHopeThisIsUnique|talk]]) 02:55, 30 ᏚᏂᏅᏗ 2019 (UTC)
:Hi! :) I'm still regularly watching this wiki for since of life or vandalism, but it has gone quiet recently. The general lack of knowledge of the Cherokee language prevents us from doing anything more than remove incorrect automatic translations and other clean-up activities.

:Beyond that, do you know of any wikis that focus on Cherokee affairs? Even if not necessarily written in Cherokee, perhaps such wikis might be helpful in preserving Cherokee culture... And in the other direction, do you know of any other Wikimedia Foundation projects that deal with Cherokee matters?

::It's always worth trying, so of course you can ask :)
::As far as I'm aware, we've got the Cherokee Wikipedia, and a lot of Cherokee affairs on the English Wikipedia, but I don't know of any wiki that focusses solely on Cherokee. --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 08:26, 31 ᏚᏂᏅᏗ 2019 (UTC)

== Greetings ==

I am very honored to find such a discussion like this. I will promote this with the (http://www.cherokeeheritage.org/) Cherokee Heritage Center the next time I am able to communicate with them. Perhaps that will get some interest going. This is a perfect way to keep the written language alive. --[[User:Tsistunagiska|Tsistunagiska]] ([[User talk:Tsistunagiska|talk]]) 10:35, 4 ᎦᎶᏂᎢ 2020 (UTC)


== The Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC): we want to hear from you. ==

At times, our contributor communities and projects have suffered from a lack of guidelines that can help us create an environment where free knowledge can be shared safely without fear. There has been talk about the need for a global set of conduct rules in different communities over time.

Recently, the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees announced a [[metawiki:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_Board_noticeboard/May_2020_-_Board_of_Trustees_on_Healthy_Community_Culture,_Inclusivity,_and_Safe_Spaces|Community Culture Statement]], asking for new standards to address harassment and promote inclusivity across projects.

The universal code of conduct will be a binding minimum set of standards across all Wikimedia projects, and will apply to all of us, staff and volunteers alike, all around the globe. It is of great importance that we all participate in expressing our opinions and thoughts about UCoC and its values. We should think about what we want it to cover or include and what it shouldn’t include, and how it may create difficulties or help our groups.

This is the time to talk about it. Before starting drafting the code of conduct, we would like to hear from you and to solicit the opinions and feedback of your colleagues. In order for your voice to be heard, we encourage and invite you to read more about [[metawiki:Special:MyLanguage/Universal_Code_of_Conduct|the universal code of conduct (UCoC)]] and then write down your opinions or feedback [[metawiki:Talk:Universal_Code_of_Conduct|on the discussion page]].

To reduce language barriers during the process, you are welcome to translate [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Universal+Code+of+Conduct&language=en&action=page&filter= the universal code of conduct main page] from English into your respective local language. You and your community may choose to provide your opinions/feedback using your local languages.

== Related conversation about Scots Wikipedia ==

Siyo! There's an interesting discussion about the Scots Wikipedia happening over at Meta, maybe some of you have already seen it: [[m:Requests for comment/Disruptive editing on sco.wikipedia on an unparalleled scale]]. Apparently that wiki also has a catastrophic problem with poorly-translated content. While the context is a bit different (chr's bad machine translations vs. sco's bad human translations) the resulting problems are similar. I'll be interested to see what approach they take to resolving them. --[[User:R12ntech|R12ntech]] ([[User talk:R12ntech|talk]]) 17:23, 26 ᎦᎶᏂᎢ 2020 (UTC)
:Wado, [[User:R12ntech|R12ntech]]. There are similarities. Hopefully our solution here is to link up with fluent speakers aided by the Cherokee Nation and/or Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to promote this wiki as a useful tool and beneficial to the preservation of the culture and language of the Cherokee at-large.[[User:Tsistunagiska|Tsistunagiska]] ([[User talk:Tsistunagiska|talk]]) 17:41, 11 ᏚᎵᎢᏍᏗ 2020 (UTC)

== Cherokee localization for Telegram! ==
Hello, Cherokee Wikipedia editors. I don't speak Cherokee, but I'm here to tell you that, since this week, Telegram has a platform for localizing/translating the app to Cherokee language. You have to join the translation discussion group here to begin translating the Telegram app: https://t.me/translation_tsalagi Thank you!

== How can I help to expand? ==
<nowiki>Hey there! This is an editor from Tagalog Wikipedia, and I was wondering if I could help expand Cherokee Wikipedia. How can I decode the alphabet? Do you know any reputable online translators for Cherokee? If there is no online translator, is there a trusted person that I can contact? Thanks! ~~~~</nowiki>
:no, no, and no. But thanks. :) [[User:Seb az86556|Seb az86556]] ([[User talk:Seb az86556|talk]]) 19:05, 7 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2021 (UTC)
:Sometimes, translators are not good. Use a dictionary.
Yes, [https://www.translitteration.com/transliteration/en/cherokee/sequoyah/ here] is a Cherokee script generator/decoder (you can do either Latin to Cherokee script or Cherokee to Latin script). I don't know of any (good) machine translators for Cherokee (apparently the Cherokee Nation is helping Google Translate add Cherokee and the Google search engine is available in Cherokee<ref>https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=chr</ref>), so I would recommend using an online dictionary.

== Country list in Cherokee ==

Hi, I just have been contributing (note I'm Australian so I don't know HEAPS of Cherokee) and I found an online list of every country and dependency name in Cherokee (written in Cherokee script). Feel free to view it [https://sites.google.com/site/tsalagianagalisgi/ here]. It would be useful so we can A expand this Wikipedia and get to 1,000 articles and B so we can (eventually) make a Cherokee version of [[:en:List of sovereign states]]. Thanks.
