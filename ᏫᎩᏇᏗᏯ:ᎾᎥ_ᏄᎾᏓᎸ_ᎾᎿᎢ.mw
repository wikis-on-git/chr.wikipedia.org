== connectivity project ==
Hallo, my name is Anastasiya Lvova, I'm "duty" in [http://toolserver.org/~lvova/cgi-bin/go.sh?language=chr&interface=en&listby=zns Connectivity project]. The essence of the "Connectivity" project is to study and [http://toolserver.org/~lvova/cgi-bin/go.sh enhance] the coherence of Wikipedia, or, in other words, to improve hypertext navigation between articles. The project deals with deadends, isolated articles, non-categorized articles, transitivity of the category tree, etc.

We want to work with your language version, but we need configured MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage for it (with direct links to template namespace pages, for example, [[:ru:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]/[[:de:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]/[[:fr:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]). Is it possible to set it up for our usage? 

thanks in advance, [[User:Lvova|Lvova]] 18:53, 12 DᎡᎭᎷᏱ 2010 (UTC)

==Page Text Editing==
We need to be on the lookout for bad tranlations into cherokee. There tends to be many words translated improperly. Sometimes this is an improper verb form or a verb put where there should be a noun and vice versa. This probably due to the fact that many dictionaries are incomplete. and example would be "run" this could be many things in English (a run in fabric, different verbal meaning such as fast movement with the feet, or the act of controlling a business or group). I don't always know the correct cherokee words either, but i recogize incorrect ones simply because i know what they mean or i use them. when i see something from one of the documents i will be more specific. Peace and love to all.

==Interface Translating==
A whole bunch of works been done already, can one of our admin's import the data from:

What exactly is this page for? --[[User:DarkFantasy|DarkFantasy]] 20:08, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Things seem to be slowing down considerably.  Any ideas on how to get others interested in ''wigiquediya''? --[[User:DarkFantasy|DarkFantasy]] 20:08, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Yes, somewhere here have discussion and pooling of minds on large problems of displaying and entering things entirely in Unicode. On my computer, even at 250% magnification, some of the characters cannot be distinguished, and I haven't yet done any of the vast work needed to *enter* in the syllabary. You might look at the talk page here in regards to Unicode.


What "it" exists, that we need/needed to contact all the entities about? (here just below)

Yes, yes, it does exist. I haven't been able to do anything with it lately until now. I would recommend calling and e-mailing all governmental Cherokee tribal groups you can. I'm going to be doing the same. --[[User:Etse|Etse]] 16:26, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)



==ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ namespace doesn't exist yet==
The namespace "Wikipedia:" hasn't been translated to "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:", so it is a bad idea to use its translation now.
You should contact a developper and ask him to put "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ"  for the "Wikipedia" namespace in the LanguageChr.php file on the server.
Once it is done, then [[{{ns:4}}:Foo]] would expand to "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:Foo"
[[User:Srtxg|Srtxg]] 02:44, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)

From a linguistic standpoint "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ" (Wikiquediya) is actually perfect. "Encyclopedia" itself is after all not of English origin, but greek. English is likely the only language in the world in which word is pronounced in-say-klo-pi-di-ya. Even then is it not uniform but only by way of dialect... Some Americans, and especially many Brits pronounce the word in-say-klo-pe-di-ya or even en-si-klo-pe-di-ya. In addition most of the western world outisde of the English language zones pronounce it similarly to the latter. We should keep in mind that English is not the only language in the world we should consider when translating/tranliterating words/documents. In fact, due to the vowel shift which took place in England between the 15th - 17th centuries, English should prety much never be considered the sole language for source translations for example, English "cow" = Cherokee "waga" which comes from Spanish "vaca" If we only considerd english for these things it would make it a lot more difficult to form words in Cherokee, since English is the Western European word that is the least phonetically similar to Cherokee. Sometimes a German ("Datsi" > Ger "Deutsch"), Spanish (Squani), French (Galvtsi > L. Gallicus) or Latin word works a lot better.

:Well, we will agree to disagree on this point.  "Digoweli Gatsanula Gadugi" is a better name "books that are fast make by working together".  WikiWiki means "fast" in Polynesian, which is where the word for Wiki came from in the first place -- "Fast Books" [[User:Jeffrey V. Merkey|Jeffrey V. Merkey]] 17:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

::The Wiktionary Project is now up. What should that be transcribed as? ᏫᎩ what?

you could say that, and i would not necessarily disagree. However the issue was not about using somethin authentically tranlated but rather the proper transliteration of Wikipedia to fit into Cherokee Phonetics (wigiquediya vs wigiquidiya). The explanation given was probably not worth disagreeing with. Furthermore, the magic of the Cherokee language is that you can get away with using fewer words than in other languages. To actually Tranlate into two words and add an extra "Digoweli Gatsanula Gadugi" would be quite impractical. especially when the alternative of sticking to the standard formation chosen by all the other languages exists... (fr, pt, sl) Wikipédia (En, es, de, ne, sw, pl, no, fi etc), Wikipedia, (ru)Википедия(wikipedia), (catalan) Viquipèdia, (welsh)Wicipedia, (icelandic) Wikipediu, (greek) Βικιπαίδεια, (turkish) Vikipedi 

Note that under the title for all of thes it has their own word for encyclopedia (english = Wikipedia the free encyclopedia)
to deviate would be somewhat risable Even in Swahili, a language which developed its own word for encyclopedia that is by no means related to the greek compound (enkyklios paideia "encircled/circular, or general education") that we now use in english, uses "Wikipedia" wikiquediya/wigiquediya is as close to perfect transliteration (not translation) as one can get.

now, for further development of our wonderful language known as Cherokee, it would be nice to develop a word/compound for encyclopedia since it has yet to exist.. that or it wold also need to be transliterated.
nigav dideloquasdi (ᏂᎦᎥ ᏗᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ) = general education, dideloquasdi alenvdodi (ᏗᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ ᎠᎴᏅᏙᏗ) = education basis, dideloquasdi alenvdisgv (ᏗᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ ᎠᎴᏅᏗᏍᎬ) = education base, Gvwatuwidv dideloquasdi (ᎬᏩᏚᏫᏓ ᏗᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ)= circular education which is a literal translation of "enkyklios paideia" or why not just enkitloquedeya (ᎡᎾᎩᏠᏇᏗᏯ)to avoid confusion between the book itself and the actuaual general education the thing to remember is that greek, as do latin and german, forms new words in much the same was as cherokee (combining old ones).
 
Wiktionary??? well, that is quite simple, though I also at first was stumped, but after thinking a bit, and realizing i also speak italian and other latin languages from which dictionary come... wiktsiyonali, witsiyonali(fr dictionnaire, sp diccionario, it dizionario (ditsiyonario), la dictionarius (diktsiyonarius)) Wiktionary is the domain and the title for most languages French Wiktionnaire and Icelandic Wikiorðabók... german calls it Wikiwortbuch in the title (by the way it is a loan translation of the latin word dictio meaning word)  you coulde theoretically tack wiki- onto the beginning of the cherokee word for dictionary,... thus, wikididetloquasdodi

==Translations==
Is there a comprehensive list of all translated namespaces, etc.? I would like to make basic items like stub notices except I don't know if they have been translated or not. [[User:Wikiacc|Wikiacc]] 22:56, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==New pages==

As far as I can see, relevant new pages are and should be welcome both in Cherokee and not. I see no evidence of a valid policy contrary to this.

Obviously, content in the language, in the syllabary, is best. Wigiqediya osdadv !


== Wigiquedia -- wouldn't Wikiquidia be better?==

Even though some of us have a hard time visually distinguishing qui from tlu, qui (rhymes with "tree" ) is much closer in sound than is que (rhymes with "day"). It seems much better to say wigi-kwee-diya for Wikipedia than to say wigi-quay-diya. In other words, the 3rd vowel of the usual chart rather than the 2nd.


Wigiquediya is perfect. it does not have to rhyme with English. On the other hand it does indeed rhyme with standard British english, as well as many American dialects and it is truer to Greek pronunciation. The origin of the latin Encyclopedia, to which it is also truer (Ancient Greek general education ενκύκλιος παιδεία enkyklios paideia Modern Greek, εγκυκλοπαιδεία, egkyklopaideia... pronounced eykiklopeideia)

== Plantagenet font ==
I recently created an SVG version of [[w:Image:Cherokee Syllabary.png]] using the Plantagenet characters. In the original PNG image, the character for "Do" (Ꮩ) looks like a capital V, but in the ([[w:Image:Cherokee Syllabary.svg|SVG version made using the Plantagenet font]], it looks like an upside down V. Is the Plantagenet font incorrect, or was the original image at fault?

I might have trouble finding my way back here, so please respond in [[w:User_talk:Sakurambo|my en:wikipedia talk page]]. [[w:User:Sakurambo|Sakurambo]] [[w:User_talk:Sakurambo|<font style="color: #f06; border: 1px solid #f6a; background-color: #fff8f0;">桜ん坊</font>]] 12:01, 9 November 2007 (UTC)


April 11, 2008: The image is not at fault. The Plantagenet font was based on the historical fonts used in the earliest printed versions of the language. Several letters were eventually reoriented or changed because some font characters were too easily confused. The "do" character was flipped because in small print, the original version and the "go" character (Ꭺ) were almost impossible to distinguish one from the other. tlw

== Meetup about and around less resourced languages ==

Hi, some of you might already know that we are going to have a meeting about and around less resourced languages on 31st of May 2008, which among others involves the Wikimedia projects, in particular Wikipedia. For most less resourced languages Wikipedia is the first collaborative project. We will talk also about tools, like Apertium which can help a lot, and about Betawiki for the localization of the User Interface of not only Wikipedias, but all Mediawiki projects in general. Furthermore you will be able to know about activities like the Open Nursery project which collects and creates contents, concentrating on less resourced languages, how elders work together with young people to keep their language alive, about kids in Africa who may not use their mother tongue at school. You will have the possibility to watch videos about topics which reach from how the UN and UNESCO see the actual language pictures to projects like a grammar checking engine, a successful localization project and some more topics.

Of course, all of you are invited to meet up with us in Cherasco (yes, there is a Wiki-Camp available) and those who cannot come are invited to follow us on web-tv (we are not sure now if we will be live or if the presentations will be online as soon as possible after they are on, but in any case you will be able to watch or the videos with relevant information or see us live.

*Click [http://gopiedmont.org/contn%C3%B9/programme-international-day-31st-may-english-language here] for the programme of the 31st of May
*Click [http://gopiedmont.org/contn%C3%B9/lodging-and-travel here] for information about lodging and travel
*Click [http://gopiedmont.org/contn%C3%B9/festa-d%C3%ABl-piemont-english-programme here] for the programme from 21st May to 1st June
*Click [http://gopiedmont.org/contn%C3%B9/eng-1-piedmont-festival-web-tv here] to watch the WEB-TV (right now there are just two videos, one slide show and the information for the wiki camp online – we are still working on the actuall programming for the conference)

Well there is one more thing to tell you/to ask: of course it is very relevant for us as a foundation to know about the actual needs in your language community, why you find the projects you contribute to useful, what are your personal goals. You can post your comments under the programme of 31st May or send an e-mail with your notes to info [at] voxhumanitatis.org. Please note that Vox Humanitatis is non-politica. More info about us can be found at our [http://voxhumanitatis.org website] where you also find the projects we support, a link to our scope and a link to our members.

Should you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to contact us.

Thank you for your attention and we hope to meet you soon!

Cheers :-) --[[User:SabineCretella|SabineCretella]] 21:37, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

== The most often used MediaWiki messages ==
Hoi, the most often used MediaWiki messages (less than 25% of all MediaWiki messages) are the most visible messages. They help our readers and editors the most. We are aiming to get these messages localised for as many languages as possible by the end of the year. Please help us and yourself and localise [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&task=untranslated&group=core-mostused&language={{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}&limit=100 these messages]. Thanks, [[User:GerardM|GerardM]] 10:44, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

==Global bots==

Hello. To facilitate [[m:steward|steward]] granting of bot access, I suggest implementing the [[m:Bot policy|standard bot policy]] on this wiki. In particular, this policy allows stewards to automatically flag known interlanguage linking bots (if this page says that is acceptable), which form the vast majority of such requests. The policy also enables [[m:Bot policy#Global_bots|global bots]] on this wiki (if this page says that is acceptable), which are trusted bots that will be given bot access on every wiki that allows global bots.

This policy makes bot access requesting much easier for local users, operators, and stewards. To implement it we only need to create a redirect to this page from [[Project:Bot policy]], and add a line at the top noting that it is used here. Please read the text at [[m:Bot policy]] before commenting. If you object, please say so; I hope to implement in one week if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interested in bot access requests. [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 13:15, 28 DᎡᎭᎷᏱ 2009 (UTC)

== Close this wiki ==

Has anyone objections against closing of this project. If there is no objections within 1 month I will support the closing of this project [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 13:15, 28 DᎡᎭᎷᏱ 2009 (UTC)

==The LocalisationUpdate extension has gone live==

The LocalisationUpdate extension is now enabled for all Wikimedia projects. From now on new localisations that become available in SVN will become available to your project within 24 hours. Your localisations get into SVN from [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net] typically within a day and at worst in two days. This is a huge improvement from the old practice where the localisations became available with new software. This could take weeks, even months.

The localisations done by our community at translatewiki.net are committed to SVN typically every day. When the system messages in English are the same as the local messages, they will now be inserted in a file and are available for use in all our projects in a timely manner

===What this means for you===
Local messages have an impact on the performance of our system. It is best when messages are as much as possible part of the system messages. In order to remove unnecessary duplication, all the messages that have a local localisation and are '''exactly''' the same as the system message will be removed.  What we ask you to do is to compare and proof read the messages in translatewiki.net and the local messages. You can then either remove local messages when the translatewiki.net message is to be preferred or, you can update the message at translatewiki.net. 

Messages that are specific to your project will have to stay as they are. You do want to check if the format and the variables of the message are still the same.

===Why localise at translatewiki.net===
When you localise at translatewiki.net, your messages will be used in all Wikimedia projects and eventually in all MediaWiki based projects. This is how we provide the standard support for your language. When messages change, at translatewiki.net you will be prompted to revisit your translations. Localising is more efficient because we have innovated the process to make you more efficient; there is text explaining about messages and we have applied AJAX technology to reduce the number of clicks you have to make.

==Translatewiki.net update==
*Currently 1.83% of the MediaWiki messages and 0.04% of the messages of the extensions used by the Wikimedia Foundation projects have been localised. Please help us help your language by localising and proof reading at [[betawiki:Special:LanguageStats/{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}|translatewiki.net]].

==How can we improve the usability for your language==
We expect that with the implementation of LocalisationUpdate the usability of MediaWiki for your language will improve. We are now ready to look at other aspects of usability for your language as well.  There are two questions we would like you to answer:
Are there issues with the new functionality of the Usability Initiative
Does MediaWiki support your language properly

The best way to answer the first question is to visit the translatewiki.net. Change the language to your language, select the “vector” skin and add the advanced tool bar in in the preferences and check out the new functionality. And make some changes in your user page. When there is a need to improve on the localisation, please make the [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-ui-0-all necessary changes]s . It should update your localisation straight away. 
We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_issues.

When there are problems with the support of MediaWiki for your language, we really want to know about this. It is best to report each issue separately. In this way there will be no large mass of issues to resolve but we can address each issue on its own. Consider issues with the display of characters, the presentation of your script, the position of the side bar, the combination of text with other languages, scripts. It is best to try this in an environment like the prototype wiki as it provides you with a clean, basic and up to date environment. The prototype wiki is available for five languages but you can select any of them, change the preferences to your language and test out MediaWiki for your language.

We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language issues. The issues you raise will all be assessed. It is important to keep each issue separate, because this will make it easier to understand the issues and find solutions.

==Fundraising 2010==
Hello Wikimedians,

As many of you are aware, we are now two months away from the Fundraiser for the Wikimedia Foundation, 2010.  We have lofty goals, and we can meet them and exceed them!

The meta translators are already actively engaged in the annual drive to distribute our messages and we encourage you to do the same, but we would like to point everyone to the developments we've made in banner messages- from creation to commentary to the ones that will go live for test and for the drive itself in November.  It's one of our goals to make sure that all volunteers know that there is a place for them in the Fundraising drive.  We've started the setup on [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 meta] for both [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages banner submission], [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Banner_testing statistical analysis], and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Committee grouping volunteers together] that would like to find specific focus and work in that area.

This year the Wikimedia Foundation is taking a proactive stance in reaching out to each and every Wikimedia project and volunteer to find innovation, collaboration, and collation of ideas from the community driven process.  The staff working on this is comprised of long-time Wikimedians with as much care and concern for the success of this drive as the volunteers, and we want you to actively participate and have a voice.

Use the talk pages on meta, talk to your local communities, talk to others, talk to us.  Engagement is what we strive for, without each other we would never had made Wikimedia succeed.  Everyone is welcome to contact any of us on staff at any time with a timely response to follow.  We actively encourage focusing discussion on meta so we can all work together.

Please translate this message into your language if you can and post it below.

See you on the wiki!  [[User:Kpeterzell|Keegan, WMF Fundraiser 2010]] 05:56, 8 September 2010 (UTC)
==Fundraising and your wiki==

Greetings, please translate this message if you can.

[[m:Fundraising 2010|Fundraising 2010]] is preparing to start, and we want your project to be a part of the global movement to support free knowledge.  The Wikimedia Foundation is engaging with local communities that build the projects to play an active part in this year's fundraiser.  This year we will be working to best serve all the language communities by providing messages that are best suited for each location.

To do this, we need your help.  We are [[m:Fundraising_2010/Messages|testing messages]] and we want to be sure that our messages will work with your language.  If it does not and your community can come up with your own banner in the spirit of supporting free knowledge, we invite you to submit your proposals and be active in this process.  Wikimedia is for you, join us in supporting free knowledge in your local community!  [[User:Kpeterzell|Keegan, WMF Fundraiser 2010]] 05:00, 15 September 2010 (UTC)

==Beat Jimmy==
Please translate this message.

The Fundraising Committee is issuing all interested community members a challenge: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 we want you to beat Jimmy]. The appeal from Jimmy Wales and the corresponding banner have been tested head-to-head with other successful banners, and the results are clear: it's our best performing message... by a lot. This year we have a lofty fundraising goal; we need all of our banners to bring in donations like the Jimmy Appeal, but no one wants to keep the Jimmy banner up for two months.  We want to run donor quotes, and other wonderful ideas, but we have to have banners that work as well as or better than the Jimmy appeal.

We've just released the highlights from a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010#Focus_Group donor focus group], and the results of our [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FR_Donor_survey_report.pdf donor survey]. With one month to the launch of the fundraiser, the messages we test must be driven by data from our tests and surveys - we can no longer rely on instinct alone. 

We've redesigned our fundraising meta pages with the Jimmy challenge; check out the survey results and propose/discuss banners that reflect these findings.  Add the banners you think will 'beat Jimmy' [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages/BeatJimmy here] to be tested Tuesday October 12 against Jimmy.

== Call for image filter referendum ==

The Wikimedia Foundation, at the direction of the Board of Trustees, will be holding a vote to determine whether members of the community support the creation and usage of an opt-in personal image filter, which would allow readers to voluntarily screen particular types of images strictly for their own account.

Further details and educational materials will be available shortly.  The referendum is scheduled for 12-27 August, 2011, and will be conducted on servers hosted by a neutral third party.  Referendum details, officials, voting requirements, and supporting materials will be posted at [[Meta:Image filter referendum]] shortly.

Sorry for delivering you a message in English. Please help translate the pages on the referendum on Meta and join the [[mail:translators-l|translators mailing list]].

==Language support group for Cherokee==
The Wikimedia Foundation has brought together a new team of developers who are dedicated to language support. This team is to support all the languages and consequently it is not realistic to expect that the team members can provide proper support for your language. It is for this reason that we are looking for volunteers who will make up a [[:translatewiki:language support team|language support team]]. 

This language support team will be asked to provide us with information about their language. Such information may need to be provided either to us or on a website that we will indicate to you. Another activity will be to test software that will likely have an effect on the running of the MediaWiki software. We are looking for people who clearly identify their ability. Formal knowledge is definitely appreciated.

As much of the activity will be concentrated on [[:translatewiki:Main Page|translatewiki.net]], it will be a plus when team members know how to localise at translatewiki.net.

== Terms of Use update ==

''I apologize that you are receiving this message in English. Please help translate it.''
 
Hello,
 
The Wikimedia Foundation is discussing changes to its Terms of Use.  The discussion can be found at [[m:Talk:Terms of use|Talk:Terms of use]]. Everyone is invited to join in. Because the new version of [[m:Terms of use|Terms of use]] is not in final form, we are not able to present official translations of it. Volunteers are welcome to translate it, as German volunteers have done at [[:m:Terms of use/de]], but we ask that you note at the top that the translation is unofficial and may become outdated as the English version is changed. The translation request can be found at [[m:Translation requests/WMF/Terms of Use 2]] -- [[m:User:Mdennis (WMF)|Maggie Dennis, Community Liaison]] 00:34, 27 October 2011 (UTC)

==2011 Fundraising Is Almost Here==
[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|left]] Hello Wikipedians, my name is Alex and I am working for the Wikimedia Foundation during the 2011 Fundraiser. This year's fundraiser is intended to be a collaborative and global effort; we recognize that messages which may  perform well in the United States don't necessarily translate well, or appeal to international audiences. <br>

I'm contacting you as I am currently looking for volunteers who are willing to contribute to this project by helping [[m:Fundraising_2011/Translation|translate]] and [[m:Fundraising_2011/Local_testing|localize messages]] into your local language, suggesting [[m:Fundraising_2011/communityappeal|community appeals]] for us to use,  and to provide us with feedback on the [[m:Fundraising_2011|Fundraising Meta Page]]. We've started the setup on [[m:Fundraising_2011|meta]] for both [[m:Fundraising_2011/Translation|translation]], [[m:Fundraising_2011/Tech_stats_and_resources|statistical analysis]], and [[m:Fundraising_2011/Local_testing|local discussion and testing]]. We actively encourage focusing discussion on meta so we can all work together. <br>Use the talk pages on meta, talk to your local communities, talk to others, talk to us.  Engagement is what we strive for, without each other we would never had made Wikimedia succeed. The staff working on this fundraiser is comprised of long-time Wikimedians with as much care and concern for the success of this drive as the volunteers, and we want you to actively participate and have a voice. Everyone is welcome to contact any of us on staff at any time with a timely response to follow.  I look forward to working with you during this year's fundraiser.

If someone could translate this message I would really appreciate it so that everyone is able to understand our goals and contribute to this year's campaign.<br>[[User:Azariv|Azariv]] 23:19, 31 October 2011 (UTC)

== Announcing Wikipedia 1.19 beta ==

Wikimedia Foundation is getting ready to push out 1.19 to all the WMF-hosted wikis.  As we finish wrapping up our code review, you can test the new version ''right now'' on [http://beta.wmflabs.org/ beta.wmflabs.org].  For more information, please read the [https://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/RELEASE-NOTES-1.19?view=markup release notes] or the [[mw:MediaWiki_1.19|start of the final announcement]].

The following are the areas that you will probably be most interested in:
* [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33711#c2 Faster loading of javascript files makes dependency tracking more important.]
* New common*.css files usable by skins instead of having to copy piles of generic styles from MonoBook or Vector's css.
* The default user signature now contains a talk link in addition to the user link.
* Searching blocked usernames in block log is now clearer.
* Better timezone recognition in user preferences.
* Improved diff readability for colorblind people.
* The interwiki links table can now be accessed also when the interwiki cache is used (used in the API and the Interwiki extension).
* More gender support (for instance in logs and user lists).
* Language converter improved, e.g. it now works depending on the page content language.
* Time and number-formatting magic words also now depend on the page content language.
* Bidirectional support further improved after 1.18.

Report any [http://labs.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Problem_reports problems] on the labs beta wiki and we'll work to address them before they software is released to the production wikis.

'''Note''' that this cluster does have SUL but it is not integrated with SUL in production, so you'll need to create another account.  You should avoid using the same password as you use here.  — [[m:Global message delivery|Global message delivery]] 23:59, 14 UᏃᎸᏔᏂ 2012 (UTC)

== MediaWiki 1.19 ==

(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to upgrade MediaWiki (the software powering this wiki) to its latest version this month. You can help to test it before it is enabled, to avoid disruption and breakage. More information is available [[:mw:MediaWiki 1.19/Deployment announcement|in the full announcement]]. Thank you for your understanding.

==Help us localise at least 65 MediaWiki messages==
One of the [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki] localisers found several errors in the MediaWiki localisation for Cherokee. These updates will not go live because the minimum number of 65 messages have not been localised. The question is therefore if someone of this community can help us and localise messages at translatewiki.net. 65 messages is the absolute requirement but it would be really great when the "[http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=core-0-mostused&language=chr most used messages]" are localised. This will have a really big impact on the users who prefer a user interface in Cherokee.<br/>

== Update on IPv6 ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it, as well as '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement on Meta]]''') 

The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to do limited testing of IPv6 on June 2-3. If there are not too many problems, we may fully enable IPv6 on [http://www.worldipv6day.org/ World IPv6 day] (June 6), and keep it enabled.

What this means for your project:

*At least on June 2-3, 2012, you may see a small number of edits from IPv6 addresses, which are in the form "<code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>". See e.g. [[w:en:IPv6 address]]. These addresses should behave like any other IP address: You can leave messages on their talk pages; you can track their contributions; you can block them. (See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] for notes on range blocks.)

*In the mid term, some user scripts and tools will need to be adapted for IPv6. 

*We suspect that IPv6 usage is going to be very low initially, meaning that abuse should be manageable, and we will assist in the monitoring of the situation.

Read [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] on how to test the behavior of IPv6 with various tools and how to leave bug reports, and to find a fuller analysis of the implications of the IPv6 migration.

== 2011 Picture of the Year competition ==

<small>[[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Translations/mk|{{#language:mk}}]] • [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Translations/no|{{#language:no}}]] • [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Translations/pl|{{#language:pl}}]]</small> 

Dear Wikimedians,

Wikimedia Commons is happy to announce that the ''2011 Picture of the Year competition'' is now open. We are interested in your opinion as to which images qualify to be the ''Picture of the Year 2011''. Any user registered at Commons or a Wikimedia wiki SUL-related to Commons [//toolserver.org/~pathoschild/accounteligibility/?user=&wiki=&event=24 with more than 75 edits before 1 April 2012 (UTC)] is welcome to vote and, of course everyone is welcome to view!

Detailed information about the contest can be found [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Introduction|at the introductory page]].

About 600 of the best of Wikimedia Common's photos, animations, movies and graphics were chosen &ndash;by the international Wikimedia Commons community&ndash; out of 12 million files during ''2011'' and are now called ''Featured Pictures''.

From professional animal and plant shots to breathtaking panoramas and skylines, restorations of historically relevant images, images portraying the world's best architecture, maps, emblems, diagrams created with the most modern technology, and impressive human portraits, Commons ''Features Pictures'' of all flavors.  

For your convenience, we have sorted the images [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Galleries|into topic categories]]. 

We regret that you receive this message in English; we intended to use banners to notify you in your native language but there was both, human and technical resistance.

See you on Commons!

== Help decide about more than $10 million of Wikimedia donations in the coming year ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
''(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it)''

Hi,

As many of you are aware, the Wikimedia Board of Trustees recently initiated important changes in the way that money is being distributed within the Wikimedia movement. As part of this, a new community-led "[[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC|Funds Dissemination Committee]]" (FDC) is currently being set up. Already in 2012-13, its recommendations will guide the decisions about the distribution of over 10 million US dollars among the Foundation, chapters and other [[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC#Eligible_fund-seeking_entities|eligible entities]].

Now, seven capable, knowledgeable and trustworthy community members are sought to volunteer on the initial Funds Dissemination Committee. It is expected to take up its work in September. In addition, a community member is sought to be the [[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC#FDC_Ombudsperson|Ombudsperson]] for the FDC process. If you are interested in joining the committee, read the [[m:Funds Dissemination Committee/Call for Volunteers|call for volunteers]]. Nominations are planned to close on August 15.
