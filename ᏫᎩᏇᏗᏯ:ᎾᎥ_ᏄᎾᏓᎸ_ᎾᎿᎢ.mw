==Ideas to aggressively delete or mostly blank poor-quality entries==
I am currently streaming a video conference about the Cherokee language and language-revitalization efforts from Western Carolina University's Cherokee Language program[https://www.facebook.com/WCUCherokeeLanguage/] where Dr. Hartwell Francis, the former director, is speaking. To paraphrase him, he stated that the Cherokee-language community has been aware of this project for a decade, but that many of the current Wikipedia articles are of remarkably poor quality because of the influence of bot-generated entries. This makes even looking at them incredibly demotivating because the challenge of fixing them is so daunting. Thus, he suggests cleaning up the project and perhaps revitalizing it through aggressive deleting of low-quality entries. 

A possible alternative to mass deletion might be mass partial blanking to encourage more human-created edits. A poor quality article could be reduced to some boiler-plate text like "XXX is in need of an article" or "XXX had the previous article replaced with this text because it was poor-quality, but please feel free to begin a new article now", but in Cherokee. I am not a Cherokee-speaker, but I could help make these edits (or teach someone else to) if a boiler-plate text and a list of the low-quality demotivating entries were provided. I plan to notify Dr. Hartwell Francis about this thread, and let him know that I believe an bold approach like this is warranted (and feasible) in order to deal with what appears like a stagnant project. Any ideas? [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 16:00, 26 ᎠᏄᏱ 2018 (UTC)

:If partial blanking or mass deletion of those pages results in more activity from native (or at least fluent) speakers, I have no objections :) Although I believe pages like [[ᏅᏃᎯ]] are also important to look at, as they seem to be bot generated articles which are not fully translated and probably incorrectly as well. --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 16:35, 26 ᎠᏄᏱ 2018 (UTC)
::Thanks for the reply Ooswesthoesbes. For ᏅᏃᎯ, yes, I'd guess, just based on hearing people talk about Cherokee Wikipedia, that a lot is probably incorrectly translated. The concept of turning articles into much shorter versions of themselves ("stubs") should also be considered. (For reference, on English Wikipedia the concept is referred to as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub#Stubbing_existing_articles "stubifying"].) If a couple sentences of useful content can be preserved or generated, then massively chopping a gargantuan poor-quality article down to a factual sentence or short paragraph is also a significant improvement.

Cherokee Wikipedia is a 2007 guinea pig victim of an [https://sourceforge.net/p/chrtrans/wiki/Home/ experiment in machine translation] run by Jeffrey Merkey.

::It's a very bad situation indeed. Automatic translation is especially bad when used for languages that are totally unrelated and function with a different grammar, such as from English to Cherokee.

Thanks [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] for starting this conversation and [[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] and [[User:Seb az86556|Seb az86556]] for providing context and clarification on the machine translation debacle. I see that editor was banned from Wikipedia a decade ago. 

I also gave some remarks at the symposium at Western Carolina (I'm Derek). I think there would be interest in organizing an edit-a-thon out at Western Carolina, and hopefully we could get some of the fluent speakers to attend along with advanced learners. It would be great if, in preparation, we could clean all the garbage articles out. I like the idea of blanking them with boilerplate. It would be nice if there was a bot to do this, but if there are just a few hundred articles, we could probably get it done manually? I'm not a speaker, but could coordinate the translation of the boilerplate or template by a fluent speaker.

What else should we be considering if we wanted to reboot this project with an edit-a-thon? --[[User:R12ntech|R12ntech]] ([[User talk:R12ntech|talk]]) 18:24, 9 ᎧᏩᏂ 2018 (UTC)

If you start mass blanking and/deleting existing pages, then Cherokee's ranking in the list would decrease to near the bottom. In the past, language editions such as Chamorro, Dzongkha, Sango, Venda, Kirundi, Inupiak, Inuktitut, Xitsonga were all proposed by various users for '''Closure''' due to the low number of articles and no native speakers contributing, Language projects that were closed down (ie. locked down) include Ndonga, Choctaw, Kuanyama, Marshallese, Hiri Motu, Afar and Muscogee.
:::::::Even Zulu wikipedia was proposed for closure in the past, now would anyone even think of closing Zulu Wikipedia? 
Mass deletion/blanking of pages will not result in a revival of Cherokee wikipedia, it would result in its continued stagnation and attract zero native speakers to edit here.
Imagine if all the stubs of Kashmiri Wikipedia were deleted right now, would a flood of Kashmiris start editing there?  Highly unlikely. 
There are other methods that can be utilized to revive a Wikipedia project and they ought to be explored. --[[User:Philip J|Philip J]] ([[User talk:Philip J|talk]]) 04:18, 27 ᎧᎦᎵ 2019 (UTC)

==Interface translation==
This Wikipedia was created before the Incubator system, so there has apparently never been a major push to complete the interface translation.

To begin, I've noticed some random pages around here, such as ''[[Zemeros flegyas]]'', a S. and SE Asian butterfly species, or [[Ayyavazhi]], a Hindu denomination. I would guess that those articles would be good candidates to delete because they are in no way connected to the Cherokee language, culture, or history, as far as I am aware.

I marked [[ᎠᏥᎸᏍᎩ]] because it appears to be a common word for flower (but can also mean either rose or orchid per the online dictionary) that is currently redirecting to the rose article. Flower (ᎠᏥᎸᏍᎩ) is a fundamental topic that should exist as a red link until a standalone article is created, in my opinion.

I marked [[ᎠᏓᏍᏕᎸᏗ]] with <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki>. It took me longer than usual to get a decent idea about what's the topic of the article. The online dictionary gives definitions of aid, charity, rescue, assist, protect, intercede, and relief for the term. Wikidata thinks it's about the Great Commandment. One reason I'm of the opinion to delete is because there isn't an apparent lead section/first sentence to orient readers. (''ᎧᏁᏨ'' means word so I'm guessing that first section is about etymology?) For what it's worth, [[:en:w:Charity (virtue)]] and [[:en:w:Charity (practice)]] are separate topics on English Wikipedia. It seems charity is the topic of the article. There have been no significant edits to the article in the last 12 years, only minor changes from Roman letters into the Cherokee syllabary since the machine-translated data dump. It just seems better to delete this one to me. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 17:56, 29 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2018 (UTC)

I'll deal with those pages once I get the necessary tools. Did you forget to place the deletion template on [[ᏕᎦᏃᏣᎸ]] or have you changed your mind? --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 10:00, 14 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)
:Great. Yes, I forgot to place the template. I'll do that now. Thank you. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 13:09, 14 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)

Please delete [[Coat of Arms]]. It's drive by tagging/vandalism. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 00:50, 24 ᎧᏩᏂ 2019 (UTC)
:Done. If any new pages are created by vandalism, you can just tag them. I will regularly check Recent changes anyway :) --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 08:14, 24 ᎧᏩᏂ 2019 (UTC)

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎦᎸᎳᏗᏦᏒ ᎠᏓᏅᏒ ᏧᎾᏁᎶᏗᎢ]] with the following rationale: One can see the discussion at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Heaven_Sent_Gaming for example. I would suspect this article was established for promotional purposes. It's just not important enough for an article here. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 19:54, 20 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC)

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎧᎹᎹ ᎤᏔᎾ]]. The article is about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae but we don't even have an article on elephant at the moment here. This topic is just too technical to be useful at this point in time on this project, in my opinion. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 20:00, 20 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC)

Similarly, I placed on <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᏏᏆᎤᏤᏣᏍᏗ]] as it's also a technical biological concept ( https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6584653 ). I went ahead and deleted the link back to that Cherokee article on Wikidata. I also went ahead and created an article on opossum with a picture ([[ᏏᏆ ᎤᏤᏥᏍᏗ]]), since we didn't previously have one. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 21:57, 20 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC) 

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[Zemeros flegyas]]. It's an Asian species of butterfly, and I don't see how there would be a Cherokee word for it. There were no hits when searching for the English word "Zemeros" in the Cherokee online dictionary. Honestly, I don't see why we should host obscure articles here that have no conceivable connection to the Cherokee language. I feel like this encyclopedia needs to prioritize things that are relevant in Cherokee if we are to attract those wishing to preserve and revitalize the language. Any article we host here, in my opinion, is an implicit request for contributions from those with Cherokee knowledge. And since Cherokee is endangered, and that resource (Cherokee knowledge) is exceedingly scarce, I feel like we should be mindful of that and typically only host relevant concepts or things of general interest to a global population. (A random Polish town or village would not qualify, for example. I recall seeing those on this site.) For examples of relevant concepts in Cherokee, [https://cherokee.org/About-The-Nation/Cherokee-Language/Downloads this link] shows files with terms for animals, insects, and plants that are documented on the Cherokee Nation website.

I placed <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[ᎠᏣᏅᏙ]]. This word is defined as ''ornament'', and despite that, this title used to host the article on plasma, which has been moved and is now at [[ᎩᎦ ᎤᎸᏌᏓ]]. An inappropriate redirect remains. Thanks. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 18:26, 29 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC)
 
I placed on <nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki> on [[Ayyavazhi]]. It is a Hindu denomination of 8 to 10 million people according to the English Wikipedia. One day when there's an article on Hinduism (one doesn't currently exists according to Wikidata) perhaps it can be mentioned there. This topic is too specialized for this project's purposes at this moment. When so many things that do have Cherokee words for them aren't covered here I just don't see the point. The same goes for [[Carl Menger]]. Perhaps he could be mentioned on an economics article should one be written. I placed the delete template there as well.

== Prolonging temporary admin access ==

@[[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] and other users: my admin access expires on the 30th of July. I would like to prolong it, as I have used it a few times the past three months. I hope you agree with that :) --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 08:11, 21 ᎫᏰᏉᏂ 2018 (UTC)

== Temporary admin access again ==
Dear people, as my admin access expired over a month ago, I would like to reapply if you all agree :) --[[User:Ooswesthoesbes|Ooswesthoesbes]] ([[User talk:Ooswesthoesbes|talk]]) 10:40, 12 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)
:Agreed. Thanks. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 13:38, 12 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)

== Site notice ==

The site notice posts "''Do you speak ᏣᎳᎩ ᎧᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ? Help us to revive the Cherokee Wikipedia! Discuss the future of this project on ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:ᎾᎥ ᏄᎾᏓᎸ ᎾᎿᎢ.''" for all newcomers to view I presume, and I just never dismiss it. I use the link to ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:ᎾᎥ ᏄᎾᏓᎸ ᎾᎿᎢ to come here from time to time. But no matter what Cherokee Wikipedia page I view right now, the link to ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:ᎾᎥ ᏄᎾᏓᎸ ᎾᎿᎢ is bold and doesn't actually link here. Any ideas? Thanks. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 13:42, 12 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)
:Well it's an active link again, and I guess I just closed out a browser window and reopened one. I'm don't know what would cause this. [[User:Biosthmors|Biosthmors]] ([[User talk:Biosthmors|talk]]) 13:52, 12 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)

== Hi guys ==

I'm one of those that originally tried to whip up some steam in regards to this Cherokee Wiki a million years ago (I added the Cherokee keyboard under the edit box etc). I'm glad to see some more people being active. I am nowhere near a good speaker though, so mostly I just help in the background. I just wanted to say I'm here too! Cheers, [[User:Nesnad|Nesnad]] ([[User talk:Nesnad|talk]]) 18:14, 28 ᎠᏄᏱ 2019 (UTC)
:Hello there! Thanks for your contributions, and thanks for saying hello. I saw [https://phys.org/news/2019-01-students-cherokee-previously-unknown-idiosyncratic.html this in the news] about students writing in Cherokee. Maybe reaching out to Tsalagi Dideloquasdi, the Cherokee immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, is worth a shot? I wish I knew more Cherokee, but I just know a tiny amount. But I'm happy to help answer questions about editing here if someone with Cherokee knowledge has any questions. Best wishes.

== Multilingual Shared Templates and Modules ==
Hello chr-wiki community! ({{int:please-translate}})

I recently organized a project to share templates and modules between wikis. It allows modules and templates to be “language-neutral”, and store all text translations on Commons. This means that it is enough to copy/paste a template without any changes, and update the translations separately. If someone fixes a bug or adds a new feature in the original module, you can copy/paste it again without any translation work. My bot ''DiBabelYurikBot'' can help with copying. This way users can spend more time on content, and less time on updating and copying templates. Please see [[mw:WP:TNT|project page]] for details and ask questions on talk page.

P.S. I am [[meta:Affiliate-selected_Board_seats/2019/Nominations/Yuri_Astrakhan_(yurik)|currently running]] for the Wikimedia board, focusing on content and support of multi-language communities. If you liked my projects like maps, graphs, or this one, I will be happy to receive your support. (any [[meta:Affiliate-selected_Board_seats/2019/Eligible_entities|registered user group]] can vote). Thank you! --[[User:Yurik|Yurik]] ([[meta:User talk:Yurik|talk]]) 05:59, 11 ᎠᎾᎠᎬᏘ 2019 (UTC)
