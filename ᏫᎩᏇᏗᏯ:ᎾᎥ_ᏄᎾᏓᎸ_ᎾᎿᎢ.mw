Hi there. I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech studying the global aspect of Wikipedia with a special interest in indigneous languages. If you are interested in being interviewed, please read the study description and consent form at : http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2005/cs6470_spring/researchstudy/webconsent_wikipedia_study1.html Thanks!

What exactly is this page for? --[[User:DarkFantasy|DarkFantasy]] 20:08, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Things seem to be slowing down considerably.  Any ideas on how to get others interested in ''wigiquediya''? --[[User:DarkFantasy|DarkFantasy]] 20:08, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Yes, yes, it does exist. I haven't been able to do anything with it lately until now. I would recommend calling and e-mailing all governmental Cherokee tribal groups you can. I'm going to be doing the same. --[[User:Etse|Etse]] 16:26, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)



==ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ namespace doesn't exist yet==
The namespace "Wikipedia:" hasn't been translated to "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:", so it is a bad idea to use its translation now.
You should contact a developper and ask him to put "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ"  for the "Wikipedia" namespace in the LanguageChr.php file on the server.
Once it is done, then [[{{ns:4}}:Foo]] would expand to "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:Foo"

==Translations==
Is there a comprehensive list of all translated namespaces, etc.? I would like to make basic items like stub notices except I don't know if they have been translated or not. [[User:Wikiacc|Wikiacc]] 22:56, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==New pages==

As far as I can see, relevant new pages are and should be welcome both in Cherokee and not. I see no evidence of a valid policy contrary to this.

Obviously, content in the language, in the syllabary, is best. Wigiqediya osdadv !


== Wigiquedia -- wouldn't Wikiquidia be better?==

Even though some of us have a hard time visually distinguishing qui from tlu, qui (rhymes with "tree" ) is much closer in sound than is que (rhymes with "day"). It seems much better to say wigi-kwee-diya for Wikipedia than to say wigi-quay-diya. In other words, the 3rd vowel of the usual chart rather than the 2nd.



==Robot vandalism==
Ok, just to notify people what has been going on here, with me and [[User:Datrio|Datrio]] deleting a total of more than 400 pages. There were several vandal robots registered, who messed up the entire place by moving pages to nonsense page names, creating vandal pages and uploading pictures. Some idiot had a lot of fun, in other words. So, I have spent the day reverting those changes, which took its time. That explains the massive number of deletes done today.

<s>Jon Harald Søby and me, we spent much time to repair everything. I hope that it will never happen again. --[[User:John Conner 1967|John Conner 1967]] 12:27, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</s>

:"John Conner 1967" was the person running these bots. [[User:Jon Harald Søby|Jon]] [[User talk:Jon Harald Søby|Harald]] [[Special:Contributions/Jon Harald Søby|Søby]] 16:39, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

== Interwiki Bot Status ==

Hi. I would like to get my interwiki bot [[user:YurikBot|YurikBot]] marked as a bot in your language. The bot is already operating in almost 50 languages, and it would lower the server load and improve the quality of articles if all interwikies are updated at the same time. You can read more or ask questions [[:en:user talk:Yurik|here]]. I always run the latest version of the [[meta:Pywikipediabot|Pywikipediabot]] (i am also one of the developers of this project). The request for the bot status is [[meta:Requests for bot status#en:User:YurikBot|here]].  Please support. Thank you. --[[:en:user:Yurik|Yurik (en)]] 20:09, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
:I don't think that should be a problem. [[User:Jon Harald Søby|Jon]] [[User talk:Jon Harald Søby|Harald]] [[Special:Contributions/Jon Harald Søby|Søby]] 20:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
:No objection too. [[User:Korg|Korg]] 22:06, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
