Hi there. I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech studying the global aspect of Wikipedia with a special interest in indigneous languages. If you are interested in being interviewed, please read the study description and consent form at : http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2005/cs6470_spring/researchstudy/webconsent_wikipedia_study1.html Thanks! [[User:Mcm|Mcm]] 


What exactly is this page for? --[[User:DarkFantasy|DarkFantasy]] 20:08, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Things seem to be slowing down considerably.  Any ideas on how to get others interested in ''wigiquediya''? --[[User:DarkFantasy|DarkFantasy]] 20:08, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Yes, yes, it does exist. I haven't been able to do anything with it lately until now. I would recommend calling and e-mailing all governmental Cherokee tribal groups you can. I'm going to be doing the same. --[[User:Etse|Etse]] 16:26, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)

==Catalonia==

I Bec you pardon, because may be Cristoforus Columbus came from Catalonia, or a atalonian country, and 
may be was the begin of the of the destruction of a piece of your culture. 

Congratulations for your wikipedia form catalonia.

==ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ namespace doesn't exist yet==
The namespace "Wikipedia:" hasn't been translated to "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:", so it is a bad idea to use its translation now.
You should contact a developper and ask him to put "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ"  for the "Wikipedia" namespace in the LanguageChr.php file on the server.
Once it is done, then [[{{ns:4}}:Foo]] would expand to "ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ:Foo"
[[User:Srtxg|Srtxg]] 02:44, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)

==Translations==
Is there a comprehensive list of all translated namespaces, etc.? I would like to make basic items like stub notices except I don't know if they have been translated or not. [[User:Wikiacc|Wikiacc]] 22:56, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==New pages==
Should all new pages be in ᏣᎳᎩ? Some anon is pushing it as official policy (even though it is not mentioned anywhere), direct quote from edit summary:

:It's OK to add content to old pages, but only add new pages in cherokee

While this is a good idea, it should be official policy first--which would require the help of Etse, who hasn't been around much lately. It would also require people to vote on it--something we're also short of. In the meantime, I will try to revert this anon's speedy-tagging (even though we have no [[Template:Delete]]) until an agreement can be reached.

== Hoax: [[The Flowers Of Romance]], please delete ==

Sorry, i don't speak the language of this Wikipedia and could not find the
Template for Deletion-Requests. However i would like to inform you that
the Article [[The Flowers Of Romance]] is an hoax, see
[http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2005-August/041315.html]
and [[:commons:Commons:Village_pump#Hoax Article in 57 languages]]
