'''[[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome]]''' to [[ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ]]! (ᎤᎵᎮᎵᏍᏗ!) We are building an [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|open-content]] [[encyclopedia]] in [[#Wikipedia in other languages|many languages]]. [[ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ]] (the Cherokee-language version of Wikipedia) started in May of 2004, we are now working on {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} [[Wikipedia:What is an article|articles]].

Starting up the Cherokee-language version of Wikipedia is quite time-consuming.  can you help? You can help by authoring articles, of course!

ᏣᎳᎩᏍ ᎯᏬᏂᏍᎩ? Learn [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|how to edit pages]], experiment in the  [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|ᏃᏯᎭ ᎧᏁᏌᎢ]], and visit our [[Wikipedia:Community Portal|Community Portal]] to find out how '''you''' can participate in the development of Wikipedia. Many of our articles are written wholly or partially in the Cherokee language. If you speak Cherokee competently, '''please''' help us to author articles. Update articles, add new articles, or scrap old articles completely and write them in Cherokee yourself.

Our goal is to eventually have a '''free''', online, Cherokee-language encyclopedia with over 1,000 quality articles (written in Cherokee) for Cherokee students. This will help to ensure that students can undergo their education '''in Cherokee''', and that Cherokee will survive, well-respected, into the next generation. While plenty of Cherokee speakers exist, many have not raised their children in Cherokee, so we are at a historic crossroads. This '''could be the last generation raised in Cherokee''', meaning that Cherokee could '''eventually''' die out, for the most part, as speakers become elderly, as has happened in the Qualla Boundary area. We need '''your''' help. (To see what ᏫᎩᏇᏗᏯ can be with ''your'' help, [[:en:|click here]].

Are you Cherokee but only English-speaking? You can '''still''' help. Are you an enrolled member of a reservation? Do you know native Cherokee speakers, or can you get in touch with them? Of course you can &mdash; quite easily in fact! Call friends, make new friends, and ask around. Help us to network. And '''learn Cherokee''' and '''help us write'''! No one is going to get mad if your Cherokee is not perfect--Cherokee is a flexible language, and we will '''applaud''' your efforts. Plus, the articles here will make it infinitely easier! So, are you concerned? You should be. Don't just stand there! Do something! :-)

A basic introduction to Cherokee is the very well-written [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_language English Wikipedia article on Cherokee].
