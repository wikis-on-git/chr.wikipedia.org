'''ᎩᏳᎦ''' is the ᏧᏣᏔᏊ ᏚᏙᎥ for any ᎤᏍᏗ [[ᏌᎶᎵ]]-like [[rodent]] species of the genus ''Tamias'' in the ᏥᏓᎾᎷ [[Sciuridae]]. About twenty-five species fall under this title, mostly native to [[ᎤᏴᏢ ᎢᏗᏢ ᎠᎺᎵᎨ]], with one species in northᎧᎸᎬᎢᏗᏢ [[ᎠᏏᎠ]]. The common species of the ᎧᎸᎬᎢᏗᏢ [[ᎠᎺᎵᎨ]] is the ᎧᎸᎬᎢᏗᏢ ᎩᏳᎦ ''Tamias striatus'', with several species in ᏄᏓᎴᎿᎥ parts of the ᏭᏕᎵᎬᏗᏢ ᎠᎺᎵᎨ.

The ᏚᏙᎥ stems from the loud ''chip'' ᎤᏃᏴᎬ that they make, in addition to a rapid [[trill]] ᎤᏃᏴᎬ . They are also called striped ᏌᎶᎵ or ᎦᏓ ᏌᎶᎵ; however, the ᏚᏙᎥ "ᎦᏓ ᏌᎶᎵ" is more usually kept for the genus ''Spermophilus'', though ''Tamias'' and ''Spermophilus'' are only two of the 13 [[genera]] of ᎦᏓ-living [[Sciuridae|sciurids]]. 

Though they are commonly depicted with their ᎤᏩᏱ up to the ᎠᎰᎵ, eating ᏚᏯᎠᏂᎳᏗᏍᎩ, or more famously their cheeks bulging out on either side, ᎩᏳᎦ eat a much more diverse range of ᎠᎩᏍᏘ than just nuts. Their [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet consists of ᎤᏛᏒᎤᎦᏔ, ᏣᎯ, ᏥᏍᏆ-ᎤᏪᏥ, and ᏣᎦᏯ. Come [[ᎤᎳᎪᎲᏍᏗ]], many species of ᎩᏳᎦ begin to stockpile these ᎠᎩᏍᏘ in their burrows, for [[ᎧᎳ]]. Other species make multiple ᎤᏍᏗ caches of ᎠᎩᏍᏘ . These two kinds of behavior are called [[larder hoarding]] and [[scatter hoarding]]. Larder hoarders usually live in their nests until [[ᎠᎹ]].

ᎩᏳᎦ are often tame even in the wild, and readily come for ᎠᎩᏍᏘ in gardens and at picnic sites in [[national park]]s and ᏣᎷᏱ; the temptation to feed or even pet them should be strictly avoided, as they can carry dangerous diseases, including [[rabies]], and in parts of the ᏭᏕᎵᎬᏗᏢ US, [[tularemia]] and [[bubonic plague]].
