'''ᎩᏳᎦ''' is the ᏧᏣᏔᏊ ᏚᏙᎥ for any ᎤᏍᏗ [[ᏌᎶᎵ]]-like [[rodent]] species of the genus ''Tamias'' in the ᏥᏓᎾᎷ [[Sciuridae]]. About twenty-five species fall under this title, mostly native to [[North America]], with one species in northeastern [[ᎠᏏᎠ]]. The common species of the eastern [[United States]] is the Eastern ᎩᏳᎦ ''Tamias striatus'', with several species in ᏄᏓᎴᎿᎥ parts of the western US.

The ᏚᏙᎥ stems from the loud ''chip'' sound that they make, in addition to a rapid [[trill]] sound. They are also called striped squirrel or ground squirrel; however, the ᏚᏙᎥ "ground squirrel" is more usually kept for the genus ''Spermophilus'', though ''Tamias'' and ''Spermophilus'' are only two of the 13 [[genera]] of ground-living [[Sciuridae|sciurids]]. 

Though they are commonly depicted with their ᎤᏩᏱ up to the ᎠᎰᎵ, eating ᏚᏯᎠᏂᎳᏗᏍᎩ, or more famously their cheeks bulging out on either side, ᎩᏳᎦ eat a much more diverse range of ᎠᎩᏍᏘ than just nuts. Their [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet consists of ᎤᏛᏒᎤᎦᏔ, ᏣᎯ, birds' ᎤᏪᏥ, and ᏣᎦᏯ. Come [[ᎤᎳᎪᎲᏍᏗ]], many species of ᎩᏳᎦ begin to stockpile these ᎠᎩᏍᏘ in their burrows, for [[ᎧᎳ]]. Other species make multiple ᎤᏍᏗ caches of ᎠᎩᏍᏘ . These two kinds of behavior are called [[larder hoarding]] and [[scatter hoarding]]. Larder hoarders usually live in their nests until [[ᎠᎹ]].

ᎩᏳᎦ are often tame even in the wild, and readily come for ᎠᎩᏍᏘ in gardens and at picnic sites in [[national park]]s and ᏣᎷᏱ; the temptation to feed or even pet them should be strictly avoided, as they can carry dangerous diseases, including [[rabies]], and in parts of the western US, [[tularemia]] and [[bubonic plague]].

===''[[Alvin and the ᎩᏳᎦ]]''===
In [[1958]] [[Ross Bagdasarian]] (using the stage ᏚᏙᎥ [[David Seville]], named after [[Seville, Spain]]) released "The ᎩᏳᎦ Song" ("Christmas, Don't Be Late"), a sped-up recording of himself performing three-part harmony. The resulting high-pitched cartoony voices were named "Alvin", "Simon", and "Theodore" after executives at the record company which published the record. "The ᎩᏳᎦ Song" went on to win two [[Grammy Award]]s and in [[1961]] lead to an [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], ''The Alvin Show''. The characters substaintially regained popularity in the early [[1980s]] with a new series, ''[[Alvin and the ᎩᏳᎦ]]'', and several [[direct-to-video]] releases in the [[1990s]], with Bagdasarian's son Ross, Jr. providing the voices of Dave, Alvin, and Simon, and his wife [[Janice Karman]] as the voice of Theodore.

===''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''===
In [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s animated movie ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', character Krunk regularly converses with ᎩᏳᎦ, in their language of squeaks. Walt Disney also created two talking ᎩᏳᎦ, [[Chip and Dale]], during the 1940's.
