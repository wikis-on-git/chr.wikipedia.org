{{main|September 11, 2001 timeline for the day of the attacks}}
Four commercial airliners were hijacked en route to [[California]] from [[Logan International Airport|Logan International]], [[Dulles International Airport|Dulles International]], and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] airports. Each of the airliners had a [[jet fuel]] capacity of nearly 24,000 U.S. gallons (91,000 liters) or 144,000&nbsp;pounds (65,455 kilograms).<ref name="Boeing">{{cite web | author= | title= Technical Characteristics Boeing 767-200ER | publisher= Boeing| date= | work=767 Family | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/pf/pf_200prod.html | accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref> Two of the airliners were flown into the World Trade Center, one each into the North and South towers, one was flown into the Pentagon, and the fourth crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to [[structural failure]] on the day of the attack. The south tower (2 WTC) fell at approximately 9:59 a.m., after burning for 56 minutes in a fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 at 9:03 a.m. The north tower (1 WTC) fell at 10:28 a.m., after burning for approximately 102 minutes in a fire caused by the impact of American Airlines Flight 11 at 8:46 a.m. A third building, [[7 World Trade Center]] (7 WTC) collapsed at 5:20 p.m., after being heavily damaged by debris from the Twin Towers when they fell.<ref name="911-ch9">{{cite book |title=9/11 Commission Report |author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |date=2004 |publisher=Government Printing Office |chapter=Chapter 9 |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch9.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Answers to Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=August 30, 2006 | url = http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm| accessdate = 2006-09-16}}</ref> Numerous adjacent buildings to the complex also had substantial damage and fires and had to be demolished.

The terrorists reportedly took control of the aircraft by using knives and [[Utility knife|box-cutter knives]] to kill [[flight attendant]]s and at least one pilot or passenger, including the captain of Flight 11, [[John Ogonowski]].<ref>{{cite web | title = We have some Planes | work = National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States | publisher = U.S. Congress |date=August 21, 2004 | url =http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch1.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-10 }}</ref>

According to the [[9/11 Commission Report]], the bombs were probably fake.

On [[United Airlines Flight 93]], [[Flight data recorder|black box]] recordings revealed that crew and passengers attempted to seize control of the plane from the hijackers after learning through phone calls that similarly hijacked planes had been crashed into buildings that morning. According to the transcript of Flight 93's recorder, one of the hijackers gave the order to roll the plane once it became evident that they would lose control of the plane to the passengers. Soon afterward, the aircraft crashed into a field near Shanksville in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]], [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], at 10:03:11 a.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|local time]] (14:03:11 UTC). Al-Qaeda leader [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]] mentioned in a 2002 interview with an [[Al Jazeera]] [[Yosri Fouda|journalist]] that Flight 93's target was the [[United States Capitol]],<ref name="watson">{{cite news |author=Watson, Jeremy |title=Bin Laden Aides Reveal Role in US Attacks |publisher=Scotland on Sunday |date=September 8, 2002}}</ref> which was given the [[code name]] "the Faculty of Law."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/09/12/alqaeda.911.claim/index.html |title=Al-Jazeera offers accounts of 9/11 planning |publisher=CNN |date=September 12, 2002}}</ref>

The attacks created widespread confusion across the United States. All international civilian air traffic was banned from landing on US soil for three days; aircraft already in flight were either turned back or redirected to airports in [[eastern Canada]]. Unconfirmed and often contradictory reports were aired and published throughout the day. One of the most prevalent of these reported that a [[car bomb]] had been detonated at the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department's]] headquarters, the [[Harry S Truman building|Truman Building]] in [[Foggy Bottom]], Washington, D.C. This erroneous report, picked up by the wire services, was reported on CNN and in a number of [[newspapers]] published that day. Soon after reporting for the first time on the Pentagon crash, CNN and other media also briefly reported that a fire had broken out on the [[National Mall|Washington Mall]]. Another report went out on the [[Associated Press|AP]] wire, claiming that a [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] [[Boeing 767|767]]&mdash;Flight 1989&mdash;had been hijacked. This report, too, turned out to be in error; the plane was briefly thought to represent a hijack risk, but it responded to controllers and landed safely in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref name="wkyc">{{cite web | last = O'Mara| first = Michael | title = 9/11: 'Fifth Plane' terror alert at Cleveland Hopkins Airport | publisher= WKYC News |date=September 11, 2006| url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/news_fullstory.asp?id=56706 | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref>

===Damage===
[[Image:6-wtc-photo.jpg|215px|thumb|right|The aerial view of the destroyed [[World Trade Center]] taken on September 23, 2001.]]
In addition to the 110-floor Twin Towers of the World Trade Center itself, five other buildings at the World Trade Center site, including [[7 World Trade Center]] and the [[Marriott Hotel]], two [[New York City Subway]] stations, and [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]] were destroyed or badly damaged. In total, in [[Manhattan]], 25 buildings were damaged and all seven buildings of the World Trade Center Complex had to be razed. Two additional buildings were later condemned: the [[Deutsche Bank Building]] across [[Liberty Street]] from the World Trade Center complex, due to the uninhabitable, toxic conditions inside the office tower and [[Borough of Manhattan Community College]]'s Fiterman Hall at 30 West Broadway due to extensive damage in the attacks.

The ''National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States'' was formed by the United States government and was commonly called the [[9/11 Commission]]. It released its report on [[July 22]], [[2004]], concluding that the attacks were conceived and implemented by members of al-Qaeda. The Commission stated that "9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack, but that the specific origin of the funds used to execute the attacks remained unknown."<ref name="national"/> To date, only peripheral figures have been tried or convicted in connection with the attacks.

===The hijackers===
{{main|Organizers of the September 11, 2001 attacks}}
Nineteen men boarded the four planes, five each on [[American Airlines Flight 11]], [[United Airlines Flight 175]] and [[American Airlines Flight 77]], four on [[United Airlines Flight 93]]. Fifteen of the attackers were from [[Saudi Arabia]], two from the [[United Arab Emirates]], one from [[Egypt]], and one from [[Lebanon]].

The group consisted of six core organizers, which included the four pilots, and thirteen others. Unlike many stereotypes of hijackers or terrorists, most of the attackers were educated and came from well-to-do backgrounds.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

===Other potential hijackers===
27 members of al-Qaeda attempted to enter the United States to take part in the September 11 attacks, but only 19 participated. Other would-be hijackers are often referred to as the [[20th hijacker]]:

====Zacarias Moussaoui====
[[Zacarias Moussaoui]] was reportedly considered as a replacement for [[Ziad Jarrah]], who at one point threatened to withdraw from the scheme because of tensions amongst the plotters. Plans to include Moussaoui were never completed because the al-Qaeda hierarchy allegedly had doubts about his reliability. He was arrested on [[August 16]], [[2001]], about four weeks before the attacks, ostensibly for an immigration violation, but FBI agents suspected he had violent intentions after receiving [[flight training]] earlier that year. In April 2005, Moussaoui pleaded guilty to conspiring to hijack planes, and to involvement with al-Qaeda, but he denies foreknowledge of the 9-11 attacks. Moussaoui, at his sentencing hearing in March 2006, claimed that, upon the personal directive of Osama bin Laden, he and [[Richard Colvin Reid|Richard Reid]] were due to hijack a fifth plane and fly it into [[White House|the White House]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Moussaoui lies 'let 9/11 happen' | publisher = BBC News| date = March 27, 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4850988.stm| accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref>

His defense lawyers dismissed this as fantasy on the part of Moussaoui, saying that he was not an operative in al Qaeda, but only a "hanger-on." In a [[Videotape|video tape]] released in May 2006, [[Osama bin Laden]] claimed that Moussaoui had "no connection whatsoever with the events of September 11" and that he knows this because "[[he]] was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers" who carried out the attacks.<ref>{{cite news | last = Markon| first = Jerry| coauthors = Karen DeYoung| title = Bin Laden: Moussaoui Played No Role in 9/11| publisher = Washington Post| date = May 24, 2006| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/23/AR2006052301262.html| accessdate =2006-09-08}}</ref>
On [[May 3]], [[2006]], a federal jury rejected the [[death penalty]] and sentenced Moussaoui to 6 life terms in [[prison]] without [[parole]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Moussaoui is spared death penalty | publisher = BBC News| date = May 4, 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4943196.stm| accessdate =2006-09-08}}</ref>
[[Image:September 17 2001 Ground Zero 04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Buildings surrounding the World Trade Center were heavily damaged by the debris and massive force of the falling twin towers]]
At Moussaoui's sentencing trial, FBI agent [[Greg Jones (FBI agent)|Greg Jones]] testified that prior to the attacks, he urged his supervisor, [[Michael Maltbie]], "to prevent Zacarias Moussaoui from flying a plane into the World Trade Center." Jones said it had been a "lucky guess." Maltbie had refused to act on 70 requests from another agent, [[Harry Samit]], to obtain a warrant to search Moussaoui's computer.<ref>{{cite news |first = Maureen |last = Dowd |title = Fly Into a Building?

====Potential hijackers denied entry into U.S.====
[[Ramzi Binalshibh]] allegedly meant to take part in the attacks, but he was repeatedly denied a [[visa (document)|visa]] for entry into the U.S.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news | last =Smith| first =Elliot Blair | title =U.S. blood 'all over his hands'| publisher =USA Today| url =http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-09-15-1acover_x.htm| accessdate = 2007-02-13 }}</ref> [[Mohamed al-Kahtani]], a [[Saudi Arabia]]n citizen, may also have been planning to join the hijackers, but [[United States Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. Immigration]] authorities at [[Orlando International Airport]] refused his entry into the U.S. in August 2001. He was later captured in [[Afghanistan]] and imprisoned at the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] prison known as [[Camp X-Ray]] at [[Guantanamo Bay Detainment Camp|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]].<ref name="Kahtani">{{cite news | last =Shenon| first =Philip | title =Panel Says a Deported Saudi Was Likely '20th' Hijacker| publisher =The New York Times| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/27/politics/27TERR.html?ex=1390539600&en=b8103e74d803a2df&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND| accessdate = 2007-02-13 }}</ref>

====Other names of potential hijackers====
Other al-Qaeda members who may have attempted, but were unable, to take part in the attacks include [[Saeed al-Ghamdi (9/11 candidate)|Saeed al-Ghamdi]] (not to be confused with the successful hijacker of the same name), [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]], [[Zakariyah Essabar]], [[Ali Abdul Aziz Ali]], and [[Tawfiq bin Attash]]. According to the [[9/11 Commission Report]], [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], the attack's mastermind, wanted to remove at least one member&mdash;[[Khalid al-Mihdhar]]&mdash;from the operation, but he was overruled by Osama bin Laden.<ref>{{cite news |title = Excerpts From Statement By Sept. 11 Commission Staff |work = The New York Times |publisher = The New York Times Company |page = 16 |date = 2004-06-17 |accessdate = 2007-02-13 }}</ref>

===Osama bin Laden===
On [[September 27]], [[2001]], the FBI released photos of the 19 hijackers, along with information about the possible nationalities and aliases of many.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/092701hjpic.htm |title=Press Release |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |date=September 27, 2001}}</ref> The FBI investigation into the September 11, 2001 attacks, code named operation [[PENTTBOM]], was the largest and most complex investigation in the history of the FBI, involving over 7,000 [[special agent]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress03/rolince062403.htm |title="The Inspector General's Report and the [[September 11]] Response", Congressional Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee |author=Rolince, Michael E., Acting Assistant Director in Charge, FBI |date=June 24, 2003 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref> The [[United States government]] determined that [[al-Qaeda]], headed by Osama bin Laden, bore responsibility for the attacks, with the FBI stating that evidence linking Al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks of September 11 is clear and irrefutable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/watson020602.htm |title="The Terrorist Threat Confronting the United States", Congressional Testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|author=Watson, Dale L., Executive Assistant Director, Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence Division, FBI |date=February 6, 2002 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref> The [[Her Majesty's Government|Government of the United Kingdom]] reached the same conclusion, regarding Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden's culpability for the September 11, 2001 attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page3682.asp |title=Responsibility for the Terrorist Atrocities in the United States, 11 September 2001 |publisher=10 Downing Street, Office of the Prime Minister of the UK |date=2001, November 14 |accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

Osama bin Laden's declaration of a [[Religious war|holy war]] against the United States, and a [[Fatwa]] [[Fatāwā of Osama bin Laden#1998 Fatwa|signed by bin Laden]] and others calling for the killing of American civilians in 1998, are seen by many as evidence of his motivation to commit such acts.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gunarathna, Rohan |title=Inside Al Qaeda, Global Network of Terror |year=2002 |publisher=Berkley Books |pages=p. 61-62}}</ref>

Bin Laden initially denied, but later admitted involvement in the incidents. On [[September 16]], [[2001]], bin Laden denied any involvement with the attacks by reading a statement which was broadcast by [[Qatar]]'s [[Al Jazeera]] satellite channel: "I stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation."<ref>[[Fox News]]. "Pakistan to Demand Taliban Give Up Bin Laden as Iran Seals Afghan Border." [[September 16]], [[2001]].</ref> This denial was broadcast on U.S. news networks and worldwide.

In November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], Afghanistan, in which Osama bin Laden is talking to [[Khaled al-Harbi]]. In the tape, bin Laden admits foreknowledge of the attacks.<ref>{{cite news | title = Bin Laden on tape: Attacks 'benefited Islam greatly'| publisher = CNN| date = December 14, 2001| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/ret.bin.laden.videotape/| accessdate = 2006-09-07}}</ref> The tape was broadcast on various news networks from [[December 13]], [[2001]].
[[Image:Bin laden 12 27a.jpg|thumb|right|Taken from the bin Laden video of [[December 27]], [[2001]]]]
On [[December 27]], [[2001]], a second bin Laden video was released. In the video, he stated "Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice, aimed at forcing America to stop its support for [[Israel]], which kills our people," but he stopped short of admitting responsibility for the attacks.<ref>{{cite news | title = Transcript: Bin Laden video excerpts

Shortly before the [[President of the United States|U.S. presidential]] election in 2004, in a [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|taped statement]], bin Laden publicly acknowledged al-Qaeda's involvement in the attacks on the U.S, and admitted his direct link to the attacks. He said that the attacks were carried out because, "We are a free people who do not accept injustice, and we want to regain the freedom of our nation."

In a videotape aired on Al Jazeera, on [[October 30]], [[2004]], bin Laden said he had personally directed the 19 hijackers.<ref>{{cite news | title = Al-Jazeera: Bin Laden tape obtained in Pakistan| publisher = MSNBC |date=October 30, 2004 | url = http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6363306/| accessdate = 2006-09-07}} - ''"In the tape, bin Laden — wearing traditional white robes, a turban and a tan cloak — reads from papers at a lectern against a plain brown background.

===Khalid Sheikh Mohammed===

===Motive===
====Statements by Al-Qaeda members====
According to official U.S. government sources, the [[September 11]] attacks were consistent with the mission statement of [[al-Qaeda]]. The overarching motivation for the present al-Qaeda campaign was set out in a 1998 [[fatwa]] issued by Osama bin Laden, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], [[Abu-Yasir Rifa'i Ahmad Taha]], [[Shaykh Mir Hamzah]], and the (Amir of the Jihad Movement in Bangladesh, [[Fazlur Rahman]]).<ref>{{cite web| title = Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders: World Islamic Front Statement|date=February 23, 1998| url = http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm| accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref> 

The fatwa lists three "crimes and sins" committed by the Americans:
 
* U.S. military occupation of the Arabian Peninsula.
* U.S. aggression against the [[Demographics of Iraq|Iraqi people]].
* U.S. support of Israel.

The fatwa states that the United States:
* Plunders the resources of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].
* Dictates policy to the rulers of those countries.
* Supports abusive regimes and monarchies in the [[Middle East]], thereby oppressing their people.
* Has [[military base]]s and installations upon the [[Arabian Peninsula]], which violates the Muslim holy land, in order to threaten neighboring [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]].
* Intends thereby to create disunion between Muslim states, thus weakening them as a political force.
* Supports [[Israel]], and wishes to divert international attention from (and tacitly maintain) the occupation of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

[[The Persian Gulf War]], the ensuing [[Iraq sanctions|sanctions against Iraq]] and the bombing of Iraq by the United States were cited in 1998 as further proof of these allegations. The fatwa uses [[Islam]]ic texts to exhort violent action against American military and citizenry until the alleged grievances are reversed, stating "[[ulema]] have throughout [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] unanimously agreed that the [[jihad]] is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries."

Statements of al-Qaeda recorded after 9/11 add weight to the U.S account of who was responsible for the attacks. In a [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|2004 video]], apparently acknowledging responsibility for the attacks, bin Laden states that he was motivated by the [[1982 Lebanon War]], for which he held the U.S. partially responsible. In the video, bin Laden also claims that he wants to "restore freedom to our nation," to "punish the aggressor in kind," and to inflict economic damage on America. He declared that a continuing objective of his [[religious war|holy war]] was to "[[bleed]] America to the point of bankruptcy."<ref>{{cite web| title = Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech| publisher = Aljazeera| date = November 11, 2004| url = http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/79C6AF22-98FB-4A1C-B21F-2BC36E87F61F.htm| accessdate =2006-09-08}}</ref> Bin Laden said, "We swore that America would not live in security until we live it truly in Palestine. This showed the reality of America, which puts Israel's interest above its own people's interest. America will not get out of this crisis until it gets out of the Arabian Peninsula, and until it stops its support of Israel." 

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] determined that the animosity towards the United States felt by [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], the "principal architect" of the 9/11 attacks, stemmed "not from his experiences there as a student, but rather from his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel."<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm |chapter=Chapter 5 |title=9/11 Commission Report |author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |year=2004}}</ref> The same motivation was shared by the two pilots who flew into the WTC: [[Mohamed Atta al-Sayed|Mohamed Atta]] was described by Ralph Bodenstein&mdash;who traveled, worked and talked with him&mdash;as "most imbued actually about... U.S. protection of these [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]] in the region." "When someone asked why he and Atta never laughed, [[Marwan al-Shehhi|Shehhi]] retorted,"How can you laugh when people are dying in Palestine?"<ref name="national"/> [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]], a hijacker aboard Flight 11 with Mohammed Atta, said in his video will, "My work is a message those who heard me and to all those who saw me at the same time it is a message to the infidels that you should leave the Arabian peninsula defeated and stop giving a hand of help to the coward Jews in Palestine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/september11/oneyearon/story/0,,789253,00.html|title=Al-Qaida tape finally claims responsibility for attacks|accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref>

Former CIA Bin Laden Unit Chief [[Michael Scheuer]] has bluntly stated that politicians are lying to the American people about the terrorists' motives, "The politicians really are at great fault for not squaring with the American people. We're being attacked for what we do in the Islamic world, not for who we are or what we believe in or how we live. And there's a huge burden of guilt to be laid at Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton, both parties for simply lying to the American people."

During the 9/11 Commission hearings, Vice Chair Lee Hamilton asked, "What motivated them to do it?" FBI Special Agent James Fitzgerald answered, "I believe they feel a sense of outrage against the United States. They identify with the Palestinian problem, they identify with people who oppose repressive regimes, and I believe they tend to focus their anger on the United States."

[[Jason Burke]], author of Al-Qaeda - The True Story of Radical Islam, makes the point that, "Bin Laden is an activist with a very clear sense of what he wants and how he hopes to achieve it. Those means may be far outside the norms of political activity as we usually understand it, but his agenda is a basically political one, though it is couched, of course, in religious language and imagery." He says bin Laden's aim is "to end the repression of the Islamic world by the hypocrite governments and the 'Crusader-Zionist' alliance supporting and manipulating them." <ref name="Burke">{{cite book| last = Burke| first = Jason| title = Al-Qaeda - The True Story of Radical Islam| publisher = I.B.

According to [[counter-terrorism]] expert [[Richard A. Clarke]], internal political conflicts within the Muslim world are the primary causal factors for the attacks of 9/11. Specifically, [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] and other residents of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, among other countries of the Middle East, believe that the vast majority of governments in the Middle East are [[apostate]] governments.<ref name="Clarke">{{cite book| last = Clarke| first = Richard| title = Against All Enemies| publisher = Free Press| date = 2004| location = New York| pages = 122-124| id = ISBN 0-7432-6024-4}}</ref> That is, these governments' collective religiosity does not meet bin Laden's standard of Muslim piety. The primary reason that bin Laden gives for this assertion is that none of these governments is a [[caliphate]]. Inspired by the Egyptian theologian and writer [[Sayyid Qutb]], bin Laden believes that it is his duty as a Muslim to establish a caliphate in the Middle East.<ref name="Clarke">{{cite book| last = Clarke| first = Richard| title = Against All Enemies| publisher = Free Press| date = 2004| location = New York| pages = 131-132| id = ISBN 0-7432-6024-4}}</ref> Arising directly from these beliefs, bin Laden designed a strategy of attacking the United States in order to establish this caliphate. Terming the United States as the "Far Enemy," bin Laden designed the attacks of 9/11 to cause the U.S. to increase its military and cultural presence in the Middle East.<ref name="Bergen">{{cite book| last = Bergen| first = Peter| title = The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader| publisher = Free Press| date = 2006| location = New York| pages = 229| id = ISBN 0-7432-7891-7 }}</ref> Bin Laden believes that once Muslim citizens of the Middle East confront the evils of a non-Muslim government, one that is not a caliphate, a popular social and [[political movement]] will catalyze around the desire for very conservative and zealous Muslim governments in the Middle East.<ref name="Bergen"/>

According to Michale Doran, this goal is further demonstrated by bin Laden's use of the term "spectacular" as a noun when talking about the attacks of 9/11. For example, "This spectacular will greatly anger America." He hoped these attacks would provoke a visceral emotional response from the government and citizens of the United States. In so doing, he was attempting to ensure that Muslim citizens in the Middle East would react as violently as possible to an increase in U.S. involvement in their region.<ref>{{cite book| last = Doran| first = Michael Scott| title = Understanding the War on Terror| publisher = Norton| date = 2005| location = New York| pages = 72-75| id =ISBN 0-87609-347-0}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom]], outrage swelled in the media when [[Jo Moore]], a special adviser to [[Transport Secretary]] [[Stephen Byers]], sent an email to staff an hour after the attacks, but before the towers had collapsed, suggesting that ''"It is now a very good day to get out anything we want to bury.

===Public response===
 
The 9/11 attacks had immediate and overwhelming effects upon the United States population. Gratitude toward uniformed public-safety workers (dubbed "[[Certified first responder|first responders]]"), and especially toward firefighters, was widely expressed in light of both the drama of the risks taken on the scene and the high death toll among the workers. Many [[police officer]]s and rescue workers elsewhere in the country took leaves of absence to travel to New York City to assist in the grim process of recovering bodies from the twisted remnants of the Twin Towers. [[Blood donation]]s also saw a surge in the weeks after 9/11.<ref>{{cite web| last = Glynn| first = Simone A| title = Effect of a National Disaster on Blood Supply and Safety: The September 11 Experience| publisher = Journal of the American Medical Association| date = May 7, 2003| url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/17/2246?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=1&andorexacttitle=and&andorexacttitleabs=and&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1119520325357_713&stored_search=&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&volume=289&firstpage=2246&journalcode=jama | doi = Vol. 289 No. 17| accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref>

Numerous incidents of harassment and [[hate crime]]s were reported against Middle Easterners and other "Middle Eastern-looking" people, particularly [[Sikh]]s, due to the fact that Sikh males usually wear [[turban]]s, which are stereotypically associated with [[Muslims]] in the United States. There were reports of [[Abuse|verbal abuse]], attacks on mosques and other religious buildings (including the firebombing of a [[Hindu temple]]) and assaults on people, including one murder; [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]] was fatally shot on [[September 15]]. He, like others, was a Sikh who was mistaken for a Muslim.<ref>{{cite web| title = Hate crime reports up in wake of terrorist attacks| publisher = CNN|date=September 17, 2001| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/gen.hate.crimes/| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref>

===Muslim American reaction===
Top Muslim organizations in the United States were swift to condemn the attacks on 9/11 and called "upon Muslim Americans to come forward with their skills and resources to help alleviate the sufferings of the affected people and their families". Top organizations include:  [[Islamic Society of North America]], American Muslim Alliance, American Muslim Council, [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], The [[Islamic Circle of North America]], and the Shari'a Scholars Association of North America. In addition to massive monetary donations, many Islamic organizations launched blood drives and provided medical assistance, food, and residence for victims.<ref>{{cite web| last = American Muslim Leaders| title = Muslim Americans Condemn Attack| publisher = ISNA| url = http://www.islamicity.com/articles/Articles.asp?ref=AM0109-335| accessdate = 2006-19-12}}</ref>

===Conspiracy theories===
{{main|9/11 conspiracy theories}}

Various [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] have emerged as a reaction to the attacks suggesting that individuals outside of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda knew of, planned, or carried out the attacks.<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Era: Power and Strategy for the 21st century |author=Lieber, Robert J. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Globalization, Culture, and Identities in Crisis |year=2005}}</ref>  These theories are not accepted as credible by mainstream journalists, scientists, or political leaders, who have concluded that [[Responsibility for the September 11, 2001 attacks|responsibility for the attacks]] and the resulting destruction rests with [[Al Qaeda]].<ref>Bazant, Zdenek P. and Mathieu Verdure.

==U.S. Government response==
===Rescue, recovery, and compensation===
{{main|Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11, 2001 attacks}}
Within hours of the attack, a massive [[search and rescue]] (SAR) operation was launched, which included over 350 [[search and rescue dog]]s.<ref>{{cite web| title = PICTURE GALLERY: The World Trade Center's Heroic Rescue Dogs| publisher =Canine Nation |date=September 15, 2001| url = http://www.dogsinthenews.com/issues/0109/articles/010915a.htm| accessdate = 2006-09-18}}</ref> Initially, only a handful of wounded people were found at the site, and in the weeks that followed it became evident that there were no survivors to be found.

Rescue and recovery efforts took months to complete. It took several weeks to simply put out the fires burning in the rubble of the buildings, and the clean-up was not completed until May, 2002. Temporary wooden "viewing platforms" were set up for tourists to view construction crews clearing out the gaping holes where the towers once stood. All of these platforms were closed on [[May 30]], [[2002]].

Many relief funds were immediately set up to assist victims of the attacks, with the task of providing [[Financial assistance following the September 11, 2001 attacks|financial assistance]] to the [[Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks|survivors]] and the families of victims. By the deadline for victim's compensation, [[September 11]] [[2003]], 2,833 applications had been received from the families of those killed.<ref>{{cite web| last = Barrett

===The War on Terrorism===
{{main|War on Terrorism}}
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the Bush administration declared a [[War on Terrorism|war on terrorism]], with the stated goals of bringing Osama bin Laden and [[al-Qaeda]] to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks.

Because the attacks on the United States were judged to be within the parameters of its charter, [[NATO]] declared that Article 5 of the NATO agreement was satisfied on [[September 12]], [[2001]], making the US war on terrorism the first time since its inception that NATO would actually participate in a "hot" war.<ref>{{cite web| title = Statement by the North Atlantic Council| publisher = NATO|date=September 15, 2001| url = http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2001/p01-124e.htm| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref>

===Domestic response===
Within the United States, Congress passed and President Bush signed the [[Homeland Security Act]] of 2002, creating the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], representing the largest restructuring of the U.S. government in contemporary history. Congress passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], stating that it would help detect and prosecute terrorism and other crimes. Civil liberties groups have criticized the PATRIOT Act, saying that it allows law enforcement to invade the privacy of citizens and eliminates [[judicial oversight]] of [[Police|law-enforcement]] and domestic [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence gathering]]. The Bush Administration also invoked 9/11 as the reason to initiate a secret [[National Security Agency]] [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|operation]], "to eavesdrop on telephone and [[e-mail]] communications between the United States and people overseas without a warrant."<ref>{{cite web| last = VandeHei| first = Jim| coauthors = Dan Eggen| title = Cheney Cites Justifications For Domestic Eavesdropping| publisher = Washington Post| date = January 5, 2006| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/04/AR2006010400973.html| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref>

Following the attacks, 80,000 Arab and Muslim immigrants were fingerprinted and registered under the [[Alien Registration Act]] of 1940. 8,000 Arab and Muslim men were interviewed, and 5,000 foreign nationals were detained under Joint Congressional Resolution 107-40 authorizing the use of [[Military|military force]] "to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States."<ref>{{cite web| title = Authorization for Use of Military Force| work = Public Law 107-40 [[S.

[[Image:911report cover HIGHRES.jpg|thumb|right|150px|9/11 Report]]
{{main|Collapse of the World Trade Center}}

A federal technical building and [[fire safety]] investigation of the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7 WTC has been conducted by the United States [[Department of Commerce]]'s [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] ([[NIST]]). The goals of this investigation, completed on [[April 6]], [[2005]], were to investigate the [[Construction|building construction]], the materials used, and the technical conditions that contributed to the outcome of the WTC disaster. The investigation was to serve as the basis for:
*Improvements in the way in which buildings are designed, constructed, maintained, and used 
*Improved tools and guidance for industry and safety officials
*Revisions to building and fire codes, standards, and practices
*Improved public safety

The report concludes that the fireproofing on the Twin Towers' [[steel]] infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, if this had not occurred, the towers would likely have remained standing. The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns to the point where exterior columns bowed inward. With the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. In addition, the report asserts that the towers' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide [[Fire escape|emergency escape]] for people above the impact zones. NIST stated that the final report on the collapse of 7 WTC will appear in a separate report.<ref>{{cite web| title = Reports of the Federal Building and Fire Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster| publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=October 26, 2005| url = http://wtc.nist.gov/reports_october05.htm| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref>

====Internal Review of the CIA==== 
The Inspector General of the CIA conducted an internal review of the CIA's performance prior to 9/11, and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism, including failing to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, as they entered the United States and failing to share information on the two men with the FBI. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amconmag.com/2005_08_01/article3.html |title=Deep Background |publisher=American Conservative| date=2005-04-01 |accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref>

====9/11 Commission Report====
{{details|9/11 Commission Report}}
The ''National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States'' ([[9/11 Commission]]), chaired by former [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Thomas Kean]], was formed in late 2002 to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks, including preparedness for, and the immediate response to, the attacks. On [[July 22]], [[2004]], the report was released. The commission has been subject to criticism.

===Civilian aircraft grounding===

==Long-term effects==
===Economic aftermath===
{{main|World economic effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks}}
The attacks had a significant economic impact on the United States and world markets. The [[Federal Reserve]] temporarily had reduced contact with banks because of outages of switching equipment in the lower NY financial district. Contact and control over the money supply, including immediate liquidity for banks, was restored within hours. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), the [[American Stock Exchange]] and [[NASDAQ]] did not open on [[September 11]] and remained closed until [[September 17]]. NYSE facilities and remote [[data processing]] sites were not damaged by the attack, but member firms, customers and markets were unable to communicate due to major damage to the [[telephone exchange]] facility near the World Trade Center. When the [[stock market]]s reopened on [[September 17]], [[2001]], after the longest closure since the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (“DJIA”) stock market index fell 684 points, or 7.1%, to 8920, its biggest-ever one-day point decline. By the end of the week, the DJIA had fallen 1369.7 points (14.3%), its largest one-week point drop in history. U.S. stocks lost $1.2 trillion in value for the week. [[As of 2007]], [[Wall Street|Wall]] and [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Streets]] near the New York Stock Exchange remained barricaded and guarded to prevent a physical attack upon the building.

The economy of [[Lower Manhattan]], which by itself is the third-largest [[Central business district|business district]] in the United States (after [[Midtown Manhattan]] and the [[Chicago Loop]]) was devastated in the immediate aftermath. Thirty percent (31.2 million [[Square foot|sq ft]], 2.7 million m³) of [[Lower Manhattan]] office space was either damaged or destroyed. The 41-story [[Deutsche Bank Building]], neighboring the World Trade Center, was subsequently closed because extensive damage made it unfit for habitation or restoration and it was scheduled for demolition. Power, telephone, and gas were cut off in much of [[Lower Manhattan]]. People were not permitted to enter the [[SoHo]] and [[Lower Manhattan]] area without extensive inspection. Much of what was destroyed was valuable [[Class A office space|Class-A]] space. The pre-2001 trend of moving jobs out of Lower Manhattan to Midtown and New Jersey was accelerated. Many questioned whether these lost jobs would ever be restored, and whether the damaged [[Tax|tax base]] could ever recover.<ref>{{cite web| last = Parrott| first = James| title = The Employment Impact of the September 11 World Trade Center Attacks: Updated Estimates based on the Benchmarked Employment Data| publisher = The Fiscal Policy Institute| date = March 8, 2002| url = http://www.fiscalpolicy.org/Employment%20Impact%20of%20September%2011_Update.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref>. Economic studies of the effects of 9/11 have confirmed that the impact of the attacks on the Manhattan office market as well as on office employment was more limited than initially expected because of the strong need for face-to-face interaction in the financial services industry <ref>{{cite web| last = Fuerst| first = Franz| title = Exogenous Shocks and Real Estate Rental Markets: An Event Study of the 9/11 Attacks and their Impact on the New York Office Market | publisher = Russell Sage Foundation|date=September 7, 2005| url = http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=800006|  accessdate = 2007-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Russell| first = James S.| title = Do skyscrapers still make sense?

The rebuilding has been inhibited by a lack of agreement on priorities. For example, [[Michael Bloomberg|Mayor Bloomberg]] had made New York's bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] the core of his capital development plan from 2002 until mid-2005, and Governor Pataki largely delegated his role to the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] which has been widely criticized for doing little with the enormous funding directed to the rebuilding efforts.<ref>{{cite web| last = Lubell| first = Sam| coauthors = Charles Linn| title = Power Struggle Heats Up While Development Moves Slowly at Ground Zero| publisher = Architectural Record| date = December 5, 2005| url = http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/051205groundzero.asp| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Buettner| first = Russ| title = Fat cats milked Ground Zero | publisher = Daily News| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/local/story/371361p-315964c.html| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref>
On the sites of the totally destroyed buildings, one, [[7 World Trade Center]], has a new [[Skyscraper|office tower]] which was completed in 2006. The [[Freedom Tower]] is currently under construction at the site and at 1,776&nbsp;ft (541&nbsp;m) upon completion in 2010, will become the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|tallest building]] in North America and one of the tallest in the world. Three more towers are expected to be built between 2007 and 2012 on the site, and will be located one block east of where the original towers stood. 
North American [[Airspace|air space]] was closed for several days after the attacks and [[Airliner|air travel]] decreased significantly upon its reopening. The attacks led to nearly a 20% cutback in air travel capacity, and severely exacerbated financial problems in the struggling U.S. [[airline]] industry.<ref>{{cite web| last = Bhadra| first = Dipasis| coauthors = Pamela Texter

===Potential health effects===
{{main|Health effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks}}
The thousands of tons of toxic debris resulting from the collapse of the Twin Towers consisted of more than 2,500 contaminants,<ref>Anita Gates, "Buildings Rise from Rubble while Health Crumbles," "New York Times," September 11, 2006, reporting on the documentary by Heidi Dehncke-Fisher, "Dust to Dust: The Health Effects of 9/11"</ref> more specifically: 50% nonfibrous material and construction debris; 40% glass and other fibers; 9.2% cellulose; and 0.8% [[asbestos]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/09/05/nyregion/20060905_HEALTH_GRAPHIC.html |title=What was Found in the Dust |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=September 5, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-08}}</ref> [[lead (element)|lead]], and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. There were also unprecedented levels of [[dioxin]] and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAHs]] from the fires which burned for three months.<ref>Dr. Dennis Charney, in the September 2006 edition of ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', the journal of the National Institute of [[Environmental health|Environmental Health]] Sciences</ref> Some of the dispersed substances (crystalline silica, lead, cadmium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are carcinogenic; other substances can trigger kidney, heart, liver and [[nervous system]] deterioration.<ref>Anita Gates, "Buildings Rise from Rubble while Health Crumbles," "New York Times," September 11, 2006, reporting on the documentary, "Dust to Dust: The Health Effects of 9/11"</ref>

This has led to debilitating illnesses among rescue and recovery workers, and the death of NYPD officer James Zadroga.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/408217p-345459c.html |title=WTC air doomed ex-cop |author=Schapiro, Rich |publisher=New York Daily News |date=April 12, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-08}}</ref> Health effects also extended to some residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Updated Ground Zero Report Examines Failure of Government to Protect Citizens| publisher = Sierra Club

There is scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products and the pollutants in the air surrounding the Towers after the WTC collapse may have negative effects on [[fetal development]]. Due to this potential hazard, a notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working near the World Trade Center towers. The staff of this study assesses the children using [[psychological testing]] every year and interviews the mothers every six months. The purpose of the study is to determine whether there is significant difference in development and health progression of children whose mothers were exposed, versus those who were not exposed after the WTC collapse.<ref>{{cite web| title = CCCEH Study of the Effects of 9/11 on Pregnant Women and Newborns| work = World Trade Center Pregnancy Study| publisher = Columbia University| date = 2006| url = http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/sph/ccceh/research/wtc_pregnancy.html| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref>

Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly following the attacks. President Bush has been faulted for interfering with the [[EPA]] interpretations and pronouncements regarding air quality. Mayor Giuliani has been faulted for urging financial industry personnel to return to the greater [[Wall Street]] area.<ref>Ben Smith, "Rudy's Black Cloud," in "New York Daily News," September 18, 2006</ref> 

''See article on EPA head [[Christine Todd Whitman]] for her position on the air quality issue.''

On [[October 17]], [[2006]], [[United States federal judge|federal judge]] [[Alvin K. Hellerstein]] rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers.<ref>Anthony DePalma, "Ruling Opens a Door for Thousands of Ground Zero Lawsuits," "New York Times," October 18, 2006, B1,</ref>

{{main|September 11, 2001 attack memorials and services}}
Memorials to the victims and heroes of the attacks of September 11 have been planned. An [[eternal flame]] was lit by the Mayor on the first anniversary of the disaster. An outdoor public [[Pentagon Memorial|memorial]] at the Pentagon is scheduled for completion in Fall 2008. Within the Pentagon itself, the ''America's Heroes Memorial'' was added in September, 2002 when the building repairs were completed. However, public access to this memorial is restricted to group tours.

The proposed design for [[Flight 93 National Memorial]] is called, "Crescent of Embrace," which has created some controversy due to its large red [[crescent]] that also points toward [[Mecca]]. Recently, due to the amount of public pressure, it has been announced that the memorial will be redesigned so as to avoid any confusion with the sign of [[Islam]]. 

Construction of the [[World Trade Center Memorial]] began in March 2006. The winning design of the [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition]] was ''Reflecting Absence'' created by [[Michael Arad]]. It is expected to open in 2009.

Many permanent memorials are being constructed around the world and a list is being updated as new ones are completed.<ref>{{cite web| coauthors = | title = 911 Memorials List| work = List of 911 and World Trade Center Memorials Across U.S. and the World| url = http://911memorials.org/usa/| accessdate = 2006-09-08}}</ref> In addition to physical monuments, some family members and friends of victims have set up memorial funds, scholarships, and charities in honor of lost loved ones.

The [[Raoul Wallenberg Award]] was given to New York City in 2001 "For all of its citizens who searched for the missing, cared for the injured, gave comfort to loved ones of the missing or lost, and provided sustenance and encouragement to those who searched through the rubble at ground hero."
